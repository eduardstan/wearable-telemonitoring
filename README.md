##### Data Download Specifications
Once the queries were refined for each topic, the data was downloaded according to the following specifications:

- **PubMed**: Data was downloaded in **NBIB format** using the default PubMed settings. 
  - Search was conducted via: [PubMed Advanced Search](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/advanced/).
  
- **Embase**: Data was exported in **RIS format**, avoiding any "Embase mapping options" (e.g., without using Emtree terms).
  - Search was conducted via: [Embase Advanced Search](https://www.embase.com/#advancedSearch/default).

- **Scopus**: Data was exported in **RIS format**, including comprehensive "Citation information" and "Abstract & keywords".
  - Search was conducted via: [Scopus Advanced Search](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri).
  
- **IEEE Xplore**: Data was downloaded in **RIS format**, including "Citation and Abstract" details. Since IEEE Xplore limits downloads to maximum 100 records per page, the data was split into multiple files (e.g., `topic_1_100_records.ris`, `topic_101_201_records.ris`).
  - Search was conducted via: [IEEE Xplore Advanced Search](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/advanced).

All data was downloaded by topic on **January 6th, 2025**, and stored in the `/data/[topic]/raw/` directory, where `[topic]` is one of the specific seven topics (e.g., `accessibility`, `ai and ml integration`, etc.) The raw data is organized according to PRISMA's principles of systematic, transparent, and reproducible research.

#### 3. **Screening Process**
The screening process was conducted according to PRISMA principles and included the following steps:
1. **SCImago Quartile 1 (Q1) Screening**: Non-Q1 papers are removed from the analysis.
2. **Title and Abstract Screening**: Reports have been screened based on title and abstract against the eligibility criteria.
3. **Full-Text Review**: Reports have been included in the final analysis after reading the full-text.

#### 4. **Deduplication Process**

We used [Mendeley Reference Manager](https://www.mendeley.com/) to deduplicate records.

#### 5. **PRISMA Compliance**
This systematic review follows the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines to ensure transparency and rigor in the review process. A PRISMA flow diagram documents the study selection process, including records retrieved, screened, and excluded.

For the framework we deliberately chose [ROBIS](ROBIS.pdf), a tool that targets risk of bias in systematic literature reviews.

#### 9. Expected Outcomes

By synthesizing evidence on telemonitoring and wearable health technologies, we aim to:
- Identify **key trends** and emerging innovations.
