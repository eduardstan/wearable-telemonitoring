   abstract = {The use of remote monitoring technology for cardiovascular electronic implantable devices has grown significantly in recent decades, yet several key questions remain about its integration into clinical care. We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway. This qualitative analysis offers insight into patient and clinician understanding of and attitudes toward remote monitoring, and may guide future efforts to improve education and patient-centeredness of remote monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {IoMT sensors such as wearables, moodables, ingestible sensors and trackers have the potential to provide a proactive approach to healthcare. But grouping, traversing and selectively tapping the IoMT data traffic and its immediacy makes data management & decision analysis a pressing issue. Evidently, the selection process for real-world, time-constrained health problems involves looking at multivariate time-series data generated simultaneously from various wearables resulting in data overload and accuracy issues. Computational intelligence of edge analytics can extend predictive capability by quickly turning digital biomarker data into actions for remote monitoring and trigger alarm during emergency incidents without relying on backend servers. But the pervasive generation of data streams from IoMT levies significant issues in data visualization and exploratory data analysis. This paper presents a genetically optimized Fuzzy C-means data clustering technique for affective state recognition on the edge. Clustering segregates the biomarker data in chunks and generates a summarized data for each subject which is then genetically optimized to avoid stagnation in local optima. A multi-level convolution neural network is finally used to classify the affective states into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The model is evaluated on the publicly available WESAD dataset and compares favorably to state-of-the-art with less time complexity. It demonstrates the use of data clustering technique for numerosity reduction of real-time data streams in intelligent edge analytics which facilitates fast analysis of affective state of the user. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {The increasing need for improved medical and healthcare monitoring systems is paramount in the current healthcare environment. This need is propelled by the continuously growing quantity of patient data, the imperative for instantaneous information, and the crucial significance of data security. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has been recognized as an essential technology for addressing healthcare requirements via the seamless integration of medical devices, sensors, and healthcare systems. Nevertheless, the effective administration and safeguarding of the extensive and delicate data produced by the IoMT present significant obstacles. The current methodologies often need to be revised to deliver holistic resolutions to these difficulties. To tackle these concerns comprehensively, the research proposed Optimized Data Management and Secured Federated Learning (ODMSM-FL), incorporating blockchain provenance. ODMSM-FL has been specifically developed to address the unique requirements of the IoMT via several capabilities, including decentralized data administration, federated learning, and solid security mechanisms based on blockchain technology. The system enhances data management capabilities, facilitating the adequate storage, retrieval, and exchange of medical data while safeguarding data privacy and maintaining data integrity. This study reports a set of numerical findings about essential performance metrics: transaction throughput (102.75 Kbps), block processing time (42.28 ms), data retrieval latency (64.02 ms), convergence rate (77.53 %), security (88.97 %), and accuracy (86.32 %). The findings prove that ODMSM-FL surpasses current methodologies, showcasing its exceptional capacity to improve data management, security, and overall performance within IoMT applications. The findings underscore the considerable potential of ODMSM-FL in effectively tackling the urgent data management and security issues in the IoMT, eventually making valuable contributions to the progress of healthcare systems and the enhanced welfare of patients. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Wireless medical sensors are used in the smart healthcare sector to capture the patient's health data and transmit it to the remote server for treatment or diagnostic purposes. Every time a cloud-based solution is adopted to collect and preserve the sensitive and personal health information. This collected patient data is shared between the different stakeholders across the network. Due to this, healthcare systems are vulnerable to confidentiality, integrity and privacy threats. Secure data access is a big challenge in such systems. In this paper, a lightweight authentication technique with the privacy-preserving schema using fully homomorphic encryption is proposed. This approach can be used for a secure access of patient data through online mode, and also the data can be shared in an encrypted format for desired purposes of stakeholders. The proposed authentication scheme is for Internet of Medical Things that can resist all network attacks and is easy to implement.

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. © 2022},

   abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.},

   abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.},

To smooth this challenge, IoT emerges as an encouraging paradigm because it provides the scalability required for this purpose, supporting continuous and reliable health monitoring on a global scale. Based on this context, an IoT-based healthcare platform to provide remote monitoring for patients in a critical situation was proposed in the authors’ previous works.

In IoT-enabled Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN), the smart sensing devices share remote patient monitoring data towards central repositories. During medical data aggregation and transmission, security is mandatory to guard against intruders. The main problem in existing base schemes is that complex multiplication operations are used for batch key creation. These schemes are computationally expensive and require huge memory space at the aggregator node (AN). This paper presents a lightweight Secure Aggregation and Transmission Scheme (SATS) for secure and lightweight data computation and transmission. SATS provides a lightweight XOR operation for obtaining batch keys instead of the expensive multiplication operation. Furthermore, the AN Receiving Message Algorithm (ARMA) is presented at the AN to aggregate data generated by sensor nodes. The Receiving Message Extractor (RME) algorithm is presented to decrypt the message and perform batch verification at the Fog-Server. SATS protects against several security threats such as denial of service attacks, the man in the middle attack, and reply attacks. The proposed SATS is simulated by using simulation tool NS 2.35. The results show that SATS provides lightweight data transmission by reducing computation and communication costs.The computation cost of the SATS scheme is 14%, 23% and 59% at AN, and at Fog-Node 6.5%, 21.5% and 51%, and Communication cost 6%, 3%, and 4% at Sensor Node, and at AN 6%, 9%, and 12% better than PPDAS, IDAP, and ASAS respectively. The proposed SATS is compared with relevant schemes and the results show that it provides better storage capacity, computations cost, communications cost, and energy consumption.},

Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data.

There are, however, security and privacy considerations in the transmission of data from these devices to the backend server, and across heterogeneous IoT networks. In this study, we propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme which is based on blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to facilitate seamless and secure transmission of user data (e.g., electronic health record (EHR)-related information) through secured swarm nodes of peer-to-peer communications. BIoTHR refers to the proposed scheme on the private blockchain-assisted EHR management using IoT. Specifically, new blockchain and swarm exchange infrastructures are suggested as a backbone of the proposed scheme to ensure secure and reliable data transmission and timely monitoring of data sent across IoT networks. An autonomous encryption-decryption mechanism is also utilized, along with a dynamic and modular server assistance technology to deploy EHR transmission in a secure manner. Moreover, several swarm-listen, announcement, peer open and peer closing algorithms are incorporated to employ the actual power of pervasive EHR transmission for better e-healthcare service provisioning. The proposed scheme is developed using the open-source tools of GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang. Proposed study simulates a number of heterogeneous IoT-based health sensor nodes, namely, body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, i.e., SPO2, galvanic skin response, and blood glucose in blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework.

It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.},

On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95%.},

Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security.

The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues.

In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage.

However, there is a risk of incorrect diagnosis when data is tampered with from the cloud or a hospital due to third-party storage services. Most of the existing systems use an owner-centric data integrity verification mechanism, which is not computationally feasible for lightweight wearable-sensor systems because of limited computing capacity and privacy leakage issues. In this regard, we design a 2-step Privacy-Preserving Multidimensional Data Stream (PPMDS) approach based on a cloudlet framework with an Uncertain Data-integrity Optimization (UDO) model and Sparse-Centric SVM (SCS) model. The UDO model enhances health data security with an adaptive cryptosystem called Cloudlet- Nonsquare Encryption Secret Transmission (C-NEST) strategy by avoiding medical disputes during data streaming based on novel signature and key generation strategies. The SCS model effectively classifies incoming queries for easy access to data by solving scalability issues. The cloudlet server measures data integrity and authentication factors to optimize third-party verification burden and computational cost. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed system optimizes average data leakage error rate by 27%, query response time and average data transmission time are reduced by 31%, and average communication-computation cost are reduced by 61% when measured against state-of-the-art approaches.},

Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE There is an increasing interest in studying the potential of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as smartphone apps and wearables, as monitoring tools for patients with cancer during or after their treatment. However, little research is dedicated to exploring the opinions and concerns of patients regarding the adoption of these technologies. This study aimed to gain insight into patients’ perspectives and preferences for participating in mHealth-based monitoring in cancer care. METHODS A qualitative study comprising semistructured interviews was conducted in the Netherlands between April and June 2023. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older with a current or past diagnosis of cancer. The interview guide was developed on the basis of the technology acceptance model, with main themes being use, communication, trust, privacy, and expectations. RESULTS Thirteen participants with urologic primary cancer were interviewed. Most patients had already some familiarity with the use of digital monitoring devices or wearables. Main barriers included persistent reminders of the illness, receiving notifications deemed unnecessary or unwanted, and the acknowledgment that mHealth technology does not serve as a substitute for human doctors. Conversely, patients recognized the potential for time-savings through the utilization of mHealth, viewed active monitoring as nonburdensome, considered mHealth a tool for reducing the communication threshold with their doctor, and expressed willingness to adopt such a platform if they perceived personal or societal relevance. CONCLUSION This study has elucidated which factors are important for successful development of mHealth for patients with cancer. While both barriers and facilitators play a role, patients’ attitudes were positive toward the implementation of remote digital monitoring, showing promising prospects for future research of mHealth in oncology. © 2024 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.},

   abstract = {Background: The use of wearable sensor technology to collect patient health data, such as gait and physical activity, offers the potential to transform healthcare research. To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participants’ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders. © 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Recent advances in smartphones and remote monitoring based on the Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled improved multidimensional intelligent services. The advent of IoT-based wearable and multimedia sensors has prevented millions of mishaps through seamless and systematic monitoring. An IoT-based monitoring system is composed of several sensor devices to measure vital signs, fall detection, energy consumption, and visual recognition. As the data collected by the sensors are transmitted to cloud storage through the Internet, data security is a major concern when transmitting data from remote locations. To improve data security and prediction accuracy, in this study, we proposed a smart and secure multimedia IoT monitoring system for smart homes backed up by smart grid supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA). The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which were based on the values collected with sequence numbers. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach provides increased prediction accuracy and better security. Hence, the proposed power-efficient prototype model monitors the entire smart home environment in real time and serves as an early warning system for critical situations. © 2024 the Author(s).},

   abstract = {Digital health tools are emerging as a promising solution for optimizing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), addressing challenges of therapy maintenance, care access, and discrete assessments. Wearable technology and mobile health platforms can offer remote monitoring capabilities, allowing for real-time virtual programming with optimization of patients' therapy, use of digital biomarkers that can help identify the onset, symptoms, medication-related fluctuations and side-effects, and response to DBS treatment. Through an investigational remote monitoring application (RM app) integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective data using wearables, we aimed to develop an accessible, data-driven digital tool to monitor patient symptoms and deliver low-burden and easy-to-access DBS therapy. The platform is designed to be compatible with several consumer-grade wearables and ensures patient data privacy and security. We conducted a feasibility study to test the tool's effectiveness in a large-scale DBS study, where subjects received a home-monitoring kit consisting of an iPhone and Apple Watch, pre-configured with the RM app to enable remote data collection. Compliance in this paper is defined as adherence to the RM app and Apple watch usage. Analysis of 67 subjects from the study demonstrated an average compliance rate of 63.3% for daily check-ins, 85.5% for monthly surveys and 61.9% for passive data with an average of 55 days of post-implant data. The study highlights the feasibility of frequent monitoring in the early post-implant period that could lead to optimal outcomes for patients. The platform developed can further optimize study execution and be extended to other chronic conditions treated with neuromodulation implants such as depression and pain.},

   abstract = {As the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to permeate the fabric of healthcare, particularly in the realms of patient surveillance and telemedicine, a transformative era beckons. This manuscript endeavors to unravel the intricacies of recent AI advancements and their profound implications for reconceptualizing the delivery of medical care. Through the introduction of innovative instruments such as virtual assistant chatbots, wearable monitoring devices, predictive analytic models, personalized treatment regimens, and automated appointment systems, AI is not only amplifying the quality of care but also empowering patients and fostering a more interactive dynamic between the patient and the healthcare provider. Yet, this progressive infiltration of AI into the healthcare sphere grapples with a plethora of challenges hitherto unseen. The exigent issues of data security and privacy, the specter of algorithmic bias, the requisite adaptability of regulatory frameworks, and the matter of patient acceptance and trust in AI solutions demand immediate and thoughtful resolution.The importance of establishing stringent and far-reaching policies, ensuring technological impartiality, and cultivating patient confidence is paramount to ensure that AI-driven enhancements in healthcare service provision remain both ethically sound and efficient. In conclusion, we advocate for an expansion of research efforts aimed at navigating the ethical complexities inherent to a technology-evolving landscape, catalyzing policy innovation, and devising AI applications that are not only clinically effective but also earn the trust of the patient populace. By melding expertise across disciplines, we stand at the threshold of an era wherein AI's role in healthcare is both ethically unimpeachable and conducive to elevating the global health quotient. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Over the past several years, many healthcare applications have been developed to enhance the healthcare industry. Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},
