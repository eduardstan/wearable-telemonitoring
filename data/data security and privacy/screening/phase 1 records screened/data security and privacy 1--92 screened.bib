   abstract = {Pregnancies impacted by diabetes face the compounded challenge of strict glycemic control with mounting insulin resistance as the pregnancy progresses. New technological advances, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), are revolutionizing healthcare delivery by providing innovative solutions for diabetes care during pregnancy. Together, AI and the IoMT are a multibillion-dollar industry that integrates advanced medical devices and sensors into a connected network that enables continuous monitoring of glucose levels. AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can predict glucose trends and suggest tailor evidenced-based treatments with real-time adjustments as her insulin resistance changes with placental growth. Additionally, mobile health applications (mHealth) facilitate patient education and self-management through real-time tracking of diet, physical activity, and glucose levels. Remote monitoring capabilities are particularly beneficial for pregnant persons with diabetes as they extend quality care to underserved populations and reduce the need for frequent in-person visits. This high-resolution monitoring allows physicians and patients access to an unprecedented wealth of data to make more informed decisions based on real-time data, reducing complications for both the mother and fetus. These technologies can potentially improve maternal and fetal outcomes by enabling timely, individualized interventions based on personalized health data. While AI and IoMT offer significant promise in enhancing diabetes care for improved maternal and fetal outcomes, their implementation must address challenges such as data security, cost-effectiveness, and preserving the essential patient-provider relationship.},

   abstract = {Digital health tools are emerging as a promising solution for optimizing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) therapy for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), addressing challenges of therapy maintenance, care access, and discrete assessments. Wearable technology and mobile health platforms can offer remote monitoring capabilities, allowing for real-time virtual programming with optimization of patients' therapy, use of digital biomarkers that can help identify the onset, symptoms, medication-related fluctuations and side-effects, and response to DBS treatment. Through an investigational remote monitoring application (RM app) integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective data using wearables, we aimed to develop an accessible, data-driven digital tool to monitor patient symptoms and deliver low-burden and easy-to-access DBS therapy. The platform is designed to be compatible with several consumer-grade wearables and ensures patient data privacy and security. We conducted a feasibility study to test the tool's effectiveness in a large-scale DBS study, where subjects received a home-monitoring kit consisting of an iPhone and Apple Watch, pre-configured with the RM app to enable remote data collection. Compliance in this paper is defined as adherence to the RM app and Apple watch usage. Analysis of 67 subjects from the study demonstrated an average compliance rate of 63.3% for daily check-ins, 85.5% for monthly surveys and 61.9% for passive data with an average of 55 days of post-implant data. The study highlights the feasibility of frequent monitoring in the early post-implant period that could lead to optimal outcomes for patients. The platform developed can further optimize study execution and be extended to other chronic conditions treated with neuromodulation implants such as depression and pain.},

   abstract = {Long-term remote patients monitoring implies minimal discomfort and reliability throughout the study period. These requirements are fulfilled by portable (wearable) patient devices, with low consumption, which transmit data wirelessly, at a short distance, to a mobile communication device (GSM) and through it, to a remote end recipient - doctor, medical center or a hospital server. The data transfer technology requires the monitored person to perform a sequence of actions, such as: selecting the appropriate application on the mobile phone, establishing a connection between the patient module and the phone, recording the data in the phone's memory, starting the data transfer from the phone to the final receiver. Practice shows that often this sequence of activities is difficult for elderly people and especially for visually impaired people, which as a result compromises the remote monitoring process. In this paper are presented an approach and conceptual implementation of a system for remote monitoring of cardiac activity, using the most popular way of remote connectivity - voice (sound) communication. In addition to the ease of use, this type of communication does not require special data protection, due to the lack of RF interfaces for short-distance data transmission. The presented results of laboratory studies, as well as conducted tests under medical supervision of patients in a cardiology clinic, confirm the workability of the proposed approach for remote monitoring of patients by audio conversion of the ECG signal.},

In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers. Â© The Author(s) 2024.},

This paper introduces a highly portable two-channel microfluidic device for simultaneous sweat sampling and the real-time detection of volatile organic compound (VOC) biomarkers. This innovative wearable microfluidic system is tailored for monitoring diabetes through the continuous and noninvasive tracking of acetone and ammonia VOCs, and it seamlessly integrates with smartphones for easy data management. The core of this system lies in the utilization of carbon polymer dots (CPDs) and carbon dots (CDs) derived from monomers such as catechol, resorcinol, o-phenylenediamine, urea, and citric acid. These dots are seamlessly integrated into hydrogels made from gelatin and poly(vinyl alcohol), resulting in an advanced solid-state fluorometric sensor coating on a cellulose paper substrate. These sensors exhibit exceptional performance, offering linear detection ranges of 0.05-0.15 ppm for acetone and 0.25-0.37 ppm for ammonia, with notably low detection limits of 0.01 and 0.08 ppm, respectively. Rigorous optimization of operational parameters, encompassing the temperature, sample volume, and assay time, has been undertaken to maximize device performance. Furthermore, these sensors demonstrate impressive selectivity, effectively discerning between biologically similar substances and other potential compounds commonly present in sweat. As this field matures, the prospect of cost-effective, continuous, personalized health monitoring through wearable VOC sensors holds significant potential for overcoming barriers to comprehensive medical care in underserved regions. This highlights the transformative capacity of wearable VOC sweat sensing in ensuring equitable access to advanced healthcare diagnostics, particularly in remote or geographically isolated areas.

   abstract = {IoT-based healthcare systems are used for remote health monitoring and diagnosis to reduce the cost of health care services. A secure transmission of health data is vital for treatment or monitoring purposes. Also, since the patient's information may be easily tracked by other devices, it must be kept safe against misuse and data alteration while being stored. IoT networks are significantly resource-constrained, with low processor capability, memory, and power, making it challenging to perform the expensive operations required by ciphering algorithms. Therefore, they need a lightweight security approach that requires fewer resources.This paper proposes a hybrid cipher method for secure data transmission from IoT healthcare devices. The encryption method combines three cipher approaches,a modified lightweight Salsa20 that uses 16-words (each word is 32-bit). First, a five-dimension chaotic map is applied to generate32-keys with the 64-bit length for each sensing data (block of bits). Second, a random shifting is used on the generated keys to seem like a dynamic key. Third, the exclusive-or operation is applied between a generated key with sensing data and modified Salsa20 words.Fourth, the DNA computing operation used in the proposed method increases security by applying the addition DNA operation between the result of the previous step with random selection word in Salsa20 state after converting them to DNA form. Finally, a hash function called SHA3-256 isapplied on sensing data that is used for data integrity when transferring data to the server. The total sent data are the hash data result, the output of DNA result after converting back to a decimal number, and two random numbers for shifting key and selecting Salsa20 word, respectively. Experiments and results of the proposed Algorithm based on NIST testing show that the proposed algorithms provide security features for data content, including confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation, and are compatible with all types of sensors to send secure data to the final administrator.},

   abstract = {E-textiles have received tremendous attention in recent years due to the capability of integrating sensors into a garment, enabling high-precision sensing of the human body. Besides sensing, a number of solutions for e-textile garments have also integrated wireless interfaces, allowing sensing data to be transmitted, and also inbuilt capacitive touch sensors, allowing users to provide instructions. While this has provided a new level of sensing that can result in unprecedented applications, there has been little attention placed around on-body edge computing for e-textiles. This study focuses on the need for a noninvasive and remote health-monitoring solution with inbuilt on-body edge computing, and how enabling such sensing and computing capabilities in a fabric environment can act as a new method for healthcare monitoring through the use of embedded computing intelligence in smart garments. Facilitating computing in e-textiles can result in a new form of on-body edge computing, where sensor information is processed very close to the body before being transmitted to an external device or wireless access point. This form of computing can provide new security and data privacy capabilities and, at the same time, provide opportunities for new energy-harvesting mechanisms to process the data through the garment. This study proposes this concept through embroidered programmable logic arrays (PLAs) integrated into e-textiles. In the same way that PLAs have programmable logic circuits by interconnecting different AND, NOT, and OR gates, we propose e-textileâbased gates that are sewn into a garment and connected through conductive thread stitching. Two designs are proposed, and this includes single- and multi-layered PLAs. Experimental validations have been conducted at the individual gates and the entire PLA circuits to determine the voltage utilization and logic computing reliability. The multilayered PLA garment superseded the single-layered garment with higher levels of accuracy in the yielded results due to the enhanced design layout, which reduces the potential for short circuits and errors occurring. Our proposed approach can usher in a new form of on-body edge computing for e-textile garments for future wearable technologies, and, in particular, with the current pandemic that requires noninvasive remote health-monitoring applications.

   abstract = {Background: Using mobile health, vital signs such as heart rate (HR) can be used to assess a patient's recovery process from acute events including acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Objective: We aimed to characterize clinical correlates associated with HR change in the subacute period among patients recovering from AMI. Methods: HR measurements were collected from 91 patients (4447 HR recordings) enrolled in the MiCORE study using the Apple Watch and Corrie smartphone application. Mixed regression models were used to estimate the associations of patient-level characteristics during hospital admission with HR changes over 30 days postdischarge. Results: The mean daily HR at admission was 78.0 beats per minute (bpm) (95% confidence interval 76.1 to 79.8), declining 0.2 bpm/day (-0.3 to -0.1) under a linear model of HR change. History of coronary artery bypass graft, history of depression, or being discharged on anticoagulants was associated with a higher admission HR. Having a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), or hyperlipidemia was associated with a slower decrease in HR over time, but not with HR during admission. Conclusion: While a declining HR was observed in AMI patients over 30 days postdischarge, patients with hypertension, T2DM, or hyperlipidemia showed a slower decrease in HR relative to their counterparts. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using wearables to model the recovery process of patients with AMI and represents a first step in helping pinpoint patients vulnerable to decompensation.},

   abstract = {Introduction: Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) provide a minimally invasive method of continuous monitoring for abnormal heart rhythms. While the benefits of ICMs are clear, current algorithm performance can be improved. The objective of this study is to assess the performance of a novel adaptive atrial fibrillation (AF) detection algorithm and separately programmable atrial tachycardia (AT) algorithm. Methods: A dual-stage detect-and-verify AF algorithm and separately programmable AT algorithm were developed. Sensitivity and PPV across a range of settings were determined in silico by comparison with an adjudicated Holter data set (n = 1966 with 229 patient days). Finally, the ability to improve performance through simulated remote programming was assessed. Results: The dual-stage algorithm detected AF in all true AF patients (76/76) resulting in a patient-level sensitivity of 100%. Episode-level sensitivity and PPV ranged from 97.6% to 100% and 79.1% to 98.5%, respectively. Thirty-six false-positive episodes were observed and 32 (88.9%) of these were corrected with programming changes. Decoupling of AF and AT durations improved PPV from a range of 10%â22% to a range of 95%â100%. Conclusions: AF and AT algorithms were designed with novel features including an adaptive morphology assessment for AF detection and separately programmable durations for AT detection. In silico performance yielded improved PPVs while maintaining high sensitivity across a range of settings. Importantly, programming changes that may be made remotely with this system reduced false positives. These algorithms allow clinicians to individualize arrhythmia detection settings thereby improving data management and reducing clinic burden.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has revolutionized today's healthcare systems and their medical services. It brings numerous benefits to healthcare organizations dedicated for enhancing patient health treatment and prevention. This technology has significantly contributed to alleviating the therapeutic suffering of patients by strengthening and enhancing remote surveillance options. Medical devices, wearable sensors, and smart objects can construct a wireless body area network (WBAN) to monitor patientsâ health conditions. In WBAN, the objects continuously communicate with each other to send, collect, analyze, exchange patient health information, and make appropriate decisions. However, due to the nature of wireless communications, security and privacy issues can negatively affect a patient's health status and personal life. Therefore, patientsâ private and health data, including location, identity information, therapeutic actions, and e-healthcare records, must be safeguarded against misuse. Most existing privacy protocols, particularly those based on pseudonyms, aim to protect patientsâ health and personal information using pseudonyms that are periodically renewed instead of their real identities. However, these protocols often lack discussions on pseudonym generation methods, revocation mechanisms and the life cycle management of pseudonyms in medical systems. In this paper, we propose a Pseudonym Revocation System (PRS) for IoT-based healthcare applications. Our approach addresses the limitations of current protocols by introducing a generic decentralized system that implements a complete life cycle of pseudonyms, from generation to revocation. It uses lightweight cryptography to secure pseudonym generation under the resource constraints of sensors. Unlike previous methods, our system is the first to ensure that pseudonyms can be seamlessly validated and verified using finite state machine without relying on a centralized authority. Pseudonym revocation has been either overlooked or inadequately addressed in previous works. In contrast, our approach incorporates both static and dynamic patient contexts, making it more dynamic and applicable in real-world scenarios.Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that PRS outperforms existing solutions in terms of privacy protection, scalability, revocation time and performance, making it a robust solution for securing patient data in IoT healthcare environments.

   abstract = {The new era of information technologies made smart healthcare by including edge, Internet of Things (loT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), cloud computing etc. This adaptation has partially replaced the old medical system, making healthcare more efficient, easy, and customized. Wireless medical sensors are used in the smart healthcare sector to capture the patient's health data and transmit it to the remote server for treatment or diagnostic purposes. Every time a cloud-based solution is adopted to collect and preserve the sensitive and personal health information. This collected patient data is shared between the different stakeholders across the network. Due to this, healthcare systems are vulnerable to confidentiality, integrity and privacy threats. Secure data access is a big challenge in such systems. In this paper, a lightweight authentication technique with the privacy-preserving schema using fully homomorphic encryption is proposed. This approach can be used for a secure access of patient data through online mode, and also the data can be shared in an encrypted format for desired purposes of stakeholders. The proposed authentication scheme is for Internet of Medical Things that can resist all network attacks and is easy to implement. The performance analysis of the proposed work shows that overall execution time (80.03%), communication cost (15.62%) and energy consumption (79.19%) is reduced in comparison with existing work.

The proposed security protocol is based on symmetric-key cryptography and addresses the challenges of anonymity, unlinkability, mutual authentication and perfect forward secrecy. Moreover, it relies on decentralised authentication, avoiding an authentication server to be the single point of attack. Besides offering strong security features, the proposed protocol and implementation take into account that sensor devices are typically constrained with respect to communication bandwidth and computation power. Therefore, these parameters are evaluated in addition to the security analysis of the presented protocol. Our solution gives stronger security guarantees than related work, while featuring a comparable computation overhead and the lowest communication overhead.},

Healthcare monitoring sensor cloud is one of the application that allows storing the patientsâ health data generated by their wearable sensors at cloud and facilitates the authorized doctors to monitor and advise them remotely. Patientsâ data at cloud must be secure. Existing security schemes (e.g., key policy attribute-based encryption [KP-ABE] and ciphertext policy attribute-based encryption [CP-ABE]) have higher computational overheads. In this paper, a security mechanism called attribute-based elliptical curve cryptography (ABECC) is proposed that guarantees data integrity, data confidentiality, and fine-grained access control. It also reduces the computational overheads. ABECC is implemented in .NET framework. Use of elliptical curve cryptography (ECC) in ABECC reduces the key length, thereby improving the encryption, decryption, and key generation time. It is observed that ABECC is 1.7 and 1.4 times faster than the existing approaches of KP-ABE and CP-ABE, respectively. Copyright Â© 2021, IGI Global.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. Â© 2022},

Methods: REALIsM-HF is an ongoing, 12-week, observational study enrolling 80-100 patients aged =45 years with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF; EF =45%) or reduced EF (HFrEF; EF =35%). Statistical analyses will include examining the association between data from wearables (the AVIVO mobile patient management patch or VitalPatch biosensor, and the DynaPort MoveMonitor), daily ePROs, and conventional HF metrics (e.g., serum/plasma biomarkers, 6MWD, KCCQ, and echocardiographic parameters). The feasibility of and patient compliance with at-home devices will be documented, and the data captured for the purpose of establishing reference values in patients with HFpEF or HFrEF will be summarized. Conclusions: The REALIsM-HF study is to evaluate the longitudinal daily activity profiles of patients with HF and correlate these with changes in serum/plasma biomarker profiles, symptoms, quality of life, and cardiac function and morphology to inform the use of wearable activity monitors for developing novel therapies and managing patients.},

However, concerns regarding risk prediction, task offloading, and data security have been raised due to the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) in remote healthcare. In this study, a new method was introduced, combines edge computing with sophisticated cybersecurity solutions. A vast amount of environmental and physiological data has been gathered, allowing for thorough understanding of patients. The system included hybrid encryption, threat prediction, Merkle Tree verification, certificate-based authentication, and secure communication. The feasibility of the proposal was evaluated by using an ESP32-Azure IoT Kit and Azure Cloud to evaluate the system's capacity to securely send patient data to healthcare institutions and stakeholders, while simultaneously upholding data confidentiality. The system demonstrated a notable improvement in encryption speed, with 27.18%, represented as the improved efficiency and achieved storage efficiency ratio 0.673. Furthermore, the evidence from the simulations showed that the system's performance was not affected by encryption since encryption times continuously remained within a narrow range. Moreover, proactive alert of probable security risks would be detected from the predictive analytics, hence strong data integrity assurance. The results suggest the proposed system provided a proactive, personalised care approach for cybersecurity-protected DT healthcare (DTH) high-level modelling and simulation, enabled via IoT and cloud computing under improved threat prediction.

   abstract = {Introduction: Future digital health research hinges on methodologies to conduct remote clinical assessments and in-home monitoring. The Collaborative Aging Research Using Technology (CART) initiative was introduced to establish a digital technology research platform that could widely assess activity in the homes of diverse cohorts of older adults and detect meaningful change longitudinally. This paper reports on the built end-to-end design of the CART platform, its functionality, and the resulting research capabilities. Methods: CART platform development followed a principled design process aiming for scalability, use case flexibility, longevity, and data privacy protection while allowing sharability. The platform, comprising ambient technology, wearables, and other sensors, was deployed in participants' homes to provide continuous, long-term (months to years), and ecologically valid data. Data gathered from CART homes were sent securely to a research server for analysis and future data sharing. Results: The CART system was created, iteratively tested, and deployed to 232 homes representing four diverse cohorts (African American, Latinx, low-income, and predominantly rural-residing veterans) of older adults (n = 301) across the USA. Multiple measurements of wellness such as cognition (e.g., mean daily computer use time = 160-169 min), physical mobility (e.g., mean daily transitions between rooms = 96-155), sleep (e.g., mean nightly sleep duration = 6.3-7.4 h), and level of social engagement (e.g., reports of overnight visitors = 15-45%) were collected across cohorts. Conclusion: The CART initiative resulted in a minimally obtrusive digital health-enabled system that met the design principles while allowing for data capture over extended periods and can be widely used by the research community. The ability to monitor and manage health digitally within the homes of older adults is an important alternative to in-person assessments in many research contexts. Further advances will come with wider, shared use of the CART system in additional settings, within different disease contexts, and by diverse research teams.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) gains myriad admiration in wide applications including medical and healthcare monitoring due to its low cost and its self-operating activities. Recently several wearable gadgets are used frequently and become popular in health monitoring systems. In the monitoring system, Biomedical Sensor Nodes (BSN) are used to sense the physiological parameters of the patients and transmitted to the coordinator or Base Station (BS) via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks for further analysis. BSNs are energy-constrained and the most amount of energy is consumed due to their information transmissions. Therefore, a key research problem is to reduce energy consumption and communication costs. Moreover, patient data, transmitted over the insecure channel may lead to security threats. Therefore, ensuring data privacy and integrity is another challenging issue. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient and secure health monitoring system to reduce the energy consumption and communication cost of the monitoring system. On the other hand, it also provides secured data transmission by incorporating a Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) based lightweight security mechanism. Extensive simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme achieved improved performance in terms of network lifetime by 27%, average End-to-end delay by 18%, and average network throughput by 23%. In conclusion, our proposed algorithms prove to be a feasible solution for securing and extending the IoMT network lifetime.

In WBANs, it must be guaranteed that the privacy of users is not exposed to unauthorised entities while sending and receiving the data. Hence, a proficient and secure authentication protocol is highly essential in WBANs. Conventional security protocols have restricted and few protocols cannot protect the privacy of users. In this work, a secure, energy-efficient, lightweight authentication protocol is proposed for securing WBAN that performs authentication session key establishment in privacy-preserving data aggregation. The proposed protocol provides confidentiality, integrity, availability and authenticity of data. Based on the security analysis, it is clear that the proposed protocol provides powerful protection than majority of the available schemes in insecure channels.

   abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  Â© 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic disorders, such as epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use, demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020, adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire, including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2% women; mean age 40.2 Â± 15.4 years), 41.6% reported using health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently (pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%). Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%) or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority (60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%, 21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2% considered data availability more important. Current health-related app use was independently associated with younger age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure occurrence (vs. seizure freedom â¥12 months) did not affect willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics. Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap.

   abstract = {The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Â© 2020 ACM.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended version of the Internet of Things that is acting a starring role in data sharing remotely. These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT's communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user's physical condition, which can be detrimental to users' finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.  Â© 2021 Aroosa et al.},

   abstract = {The exponential growth of produced data by healthcare monitoring devices poses a substantial challenge for conventional fog-based computing frameworks. Fog computing, a dispersed computing prototype that expands fog computing capabilities to the network's edge, emerges as a promising solution to address this challenge. This paper, proposes a technique for offloading computations for healthcare monitoring in fog computing, aiming to minimize task completion time, consumption of energy, execution time ratio and response time analysis. Enhancing Healthcare Monitoring with Optimal Computation Offloading in Fog Environment specifies that the research is focused on improving healthcare monitoring systems through the use of fog computing. In this approach, data processing is carried out closer to the source, such as medical devices or sensors, instead of depending only on centralized cloud servers. The "computation offloading" technique is moving computational workloads from less powerful devices to edge or fog nodes with more processing power. By using this method, the research seeks to improve real-time data processing, minimize latency, maximize resource use, and improve security in healthcare monitoring by retaining confidential data closer to its source. The goal of the study is to show how this strategy might result in healthcare monitoring systems that are more effective and efficient, especially when quick decisions and great data security are required. The proposed technique dynamically offloads computation tasks to fog nodes based on real-time network conditions, resource availability, and task characteristics. It emphasizes the achievement of superior performance metrics including the shortest job completion time, lowest energy consumption, and minimal cost compared to existing task offloading methods within healthcare contexts. The technique notably achieves a reduction of up to 31.1% in task completion time, 66.67% in energy consumption, and 20% in execution time ratio compared to existing task offloading methods in healthcare contexts. Additionally, it improves response time by 40%, demonstrating superior performance metrics. It conducts a thorough assessment of the proposed techniqueâs effectiveness through key performance indicators such as Task Completion Time, Energy Consumption, Execution Time Ratio, and Response Time Analysis. Finally, a detailed comparative analysis against established techniques enriches the discussion, providing valuable insights into the superiority of the proposed technique.

   abstract = {The usage of IoT in the medical field, often referred to as IoMT, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of sensitive data among medical devices. This capability significantly contributes to enhancing the quality of patient care. However, it comes with privacy issues that compromise the security of the data collected by medical sensors, making them vulnerable to potential cyber threats such as data modification, replay attacks, etc. These attacks can lead to significant data loss or unauthorized alterations. Machine learning, particularly in cyber-attack detection systems, is crucial for identifying and classifying such attacks. Yet, the main challenge lies in adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of malicious attacks and creating scalable solutions to combat them. The objective of this paper is to detect cybersecurity threats, with a particular focus on man-in-the-middle attacks that occur within the IoMT communication network. The study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and employs multi-layer perceptron to classify unforeseen cyber-attack IoT-based healthcare devices. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this proposed strategy using real-time data from the St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (WUSTL-EHMS). The findings indicate that the multi-layer perceptron outperforms other tested classifiers, achieving an accuracy score of 96.39%, while also improving the performance by reducing the time complexity.

   abstract = {Background: Functional decline in Alzheimerâs disease (AD) is typically measured using single-time point subjective rating scales, which rely on direct observation or (caregiver) recall. Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs), such as smartphone applications, wearables, and home-based sensors, can change these periodic subjective assessments to more frequent, or even continuous, objective monitoring. The aim of the RADAR-AD study is to assess the accuracy and validity of RMTs in measuring functional decline in a real-world environment across preclinical-to-moderate stages of AD compared to standard clinical rating scales. Methods: This study includes three tiers. For the main study, we will include participants (n = 220) with preclinical AD, prodromal AD, mild-to-moderate AD, and healthy controls, classified by MMSE and CDR score, from clinical sites equally distributed over 13 European countries. Participants will undergo extensive neuropsychological testing and physical examination. The RMT assessments, performed over an 8-week period, include walk tests, financial management tasks, an augmented reality game, two activity trackers, and two smartphone applications installed on the participantsâ phone. In the first sub-study, fixed sensors will be installed in the homes of a representative sub-sample of 40 participants. In the second sub-study, 10 participants will stay in a smart home for 1 week. The primary outcome of this study is the difference in functional domain profiles assessed using RMTs between the four study groups. The four participant groups will be compared for each RMT outcome measure separately. Each RMT outcome will be compared to a standard clinical test which measures the same functional or cognitive domain. Finally, multivariate prediction models will be developed. Data collection and privacy are important aspects of the project, which will be managed using the RADAR-base data platform running on specifically designed biomedical research computing infrastructure. Results: First results are expected to be disseminated in 2022. Conclusion: Our study is well placed to evaluate the clinical utility of RMT assessments. Leveraging modern-day technology may deliver new and improved methods for accurately monitoring functional decline in all stages of AD. It is greatly anticipated that these methods could lead to objective and real-life functional endpoints with increased sensitivity to pharmacological agent signal detection. Â© 2021, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background: Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer pose significant global health challenges, contributing to a substantial portion of worldwide mortality. Diagnosing heart disease, with its diverse signs and symptoms, remains a complex task. The growing market for connected wearable devices presents opportunities for leveraging Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in healthcare. However, diagnosing and managing heart disease effectively remains a critical concern due to its high fatality rates. Integrating IoT into the traditional healthcare system holds promise for enhancing patient outcomes, particularly for those with heart disease. Methods: A Healthcare Monitoring-based IoT framework (HM-IoT) has been developed to enable continuous monitoring of heart disease patients, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction. This framework facilitates real-time monitoring of heart failure patients through IoT-enabled devices. Data encryption using the Enhanced Encryption Standard algorithm ensures the security of patient information within the cloud platform. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is employed to classify encrypted data, promptly alerting healthcare professionals to abnormal physiological conditions. Results: Evaluation in Matlab revealed impressive processing capabilities, with decryption and encryption rates of 1085 milliseconds and 1075 milliseconds, respectively. Data protection level reached 91%, while the Security Rate level attained 99%. Performance metrics, including Accuracy (98%), Sensitivity (96%), Specificity (98%), and Precision (99.4%), demonstrated the reliability of the system in detecting potential instances of heart disease. Conclusion: The Healthcare Monitoring-based IoT framework represents a significant advancement in smart healthcare solutions for heart disease management. By integrating IoT technologies with healthcare infrastructure, the framework enables real-time monitoring, enhancing prognostic capabilities and facilitating timely interventions.

Wearable and remote sensing technologies have advanced data collection outside of laboratory settings to enable exploring, in more detail, the associations of early experiences with brain development and social and health outcomes. In the HBCD Study, the Novel Technology/Wearable Sensors Working Group (WG-NTW) identified two primary data types to be collected: infant activity (by measuring leg movements) and sleep (by measuring heart rate and leg movements). These wearable technologies allow for remote collection in the natural environment. This paper illustrates the collection of such data via wearable technologies and describes the decision-making framework, which led to the currently deployed study design, data collection protocol, and derivatives, which will be made publicly available. Moreover, considerations regarding actual and potential challenges to adoption and use, data management, privacy, and participant burden were examined. Lastly, the present limitations in the field of wearable sensor data collection and analysis will be discussed in terms of extant validation studies, the difficulties in comparing performance across different devices, and the impact of evolving hardware/software/firmware.

The proposed system employs state-of-the-art IoT microcontrollers and hardware devices and integrates them in a manner that significantly affects the accuracy and speed of the entire system. Furthermore, the information gathered from IoT is securely transferred through private channels and stored on the cloud, which can be accessed authentically and reliably using an information system built into an IoT application. The output was extensively compared in terms of power consumption and delivery ratio, which were based on the values collected with sequence numbers. The comparative analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach provides increased prediction accuracy and better security. Hence, the proposed power-efficient prototype model monitors the entire smart home environment in real time and serves as an early warning system for critical situations. Â© 2024 the Author(s).},

   abstract = {Policy Points Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the âlittle sisterâ of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patientsâ normative claims for access to digital health data. Â© 2020 Milbank Memorial Fund},

   abstract = {The wearable tech revolution and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets have created exciting new opportunities for remote patient monitoring. Healthcare providers are increasingly utilizing wearable technologies to expedite the process of diagnosis and treatment. The healthcare and research fields have been substantially impacted by emerging technologies. On the other hand, there are legitimate worries regarding the security of data transfers and transaction recording upon using these technologies. Healthcare departments need easy data interchange for interoperability. Protecting data security and integrity is crucial when exchanging information with authorized parties. In many existing solutions, patientsâ sensitive data is collected and stored in smart healthcare systems. Scalability, breach or unauthorized access to this data can compromise privacy. The adoption of blockchain technology is one way to safeguard patient privacy in healthcare. Also, by facilitating the safe and secure exchange of data, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by making traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment more reliable. However, blockchain has serious problems with its highly limited scalability. This article suggests a new method âSHORTBLOCKSâ depending on blockchain technology for the safe administration and analysis of data. To circumvent the security-scalability issue and achieve high throughput, this study employs the newly introduced protocol âSHORTBLOCKSâ, which extends blockchain concept to a direct acyclic graph of blocks. The proposed system uses both a private and a public blockchain that are created on the new protocol. In order to analyze patient health data, a system using smart contracts and a private blockchain is built. The system logs the occurrence to the public blockchain in the case that the smart contract raises an alarm due to an unusual reading. This will fix the scalability issue with initial blockchain as well as the security and privacy issues involved in remote patient monitoring. Simulation results shows the performance of the proposed system by comparing with existing solutions, SPECTRE protocol and GHOSTDAG protocol. Â© 2024 SCPE.},

   abstract = {Background: The use of digital biomarkers through remote patient monitoring offers valuable and timely insights into a patientâs condition, including aspects such as disease progression and treatment response. This serves as a complementary resource to traditional health care settings leveraging mobile technology to improve scale and lower latency, cost, and burden. Objective: Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors have immense potential for improving health care through various apps and mobile health (mHealth) platforms. This capability could enable the development of reliable digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely from patients. Methods: We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support large-scale data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a modern remote data collection platform built around Confluentâs Apache Kafka to support scalability, extensibility, security, privacy, and quality of data. It provides support for study design and setup and active (eg, patient-reported outcome measures) and passive (eg, phone sensors, wearable devices, and Internet of Things) remote data collection capabilities with feature generation (eg, behavioral, environmental, and physiological markers). The back end enables secure data transmission and scalable solutions for data storage, management, and data access. Results: The platform has been used to successfully collect longitudinal data for various cohorts in a number of disease areas including multiple sclerosis, depression, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, autism, and lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases. Conclusions: RADAR-base offers a contemporary, open-source solution driven by the community for remotely monitoring, collecting data, and digitally characterizing both physical and mental health conditions. Clinicians have the ability to enhance their insight through the use of digital biomarkers, enabling improved prevention, personalization, and early intervention in the context of disease management.

   abstract = {Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions.

   abstract = {PURPOSE There is an increasing interest in studying the potential of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as smartphone apps and wearables, as monitoring tools for patients with cancer during or after their treatment. However, little research is dedicated to exploring the opinions and concerns of patients regarding the adoption of these technologies. This study aimed to gain insight into patientsâ perspectives and preferences for participating in mHealth-based monitoring in cancer care. METHODS A qualitative study comprising semistructured interviews was conducted in the Netherlands between April and June 2023. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older with a current or past diagnosis of cancer. The interview guide was developed on the basis of the technology acceptance model, with main themes being use, communication, trust, privacy, and expectations. RESULTS Thirteen participants with urologic primary cancer were interviewed. Most patients had already some familiarity with the use of digital monitoring devices or wearables. Main barriers included persistent reminders of the illness, receiving notifications deemed unnecessary or unwanted, and the acknowledgment that mHealth technology does not serve as a substitute for human doctors. Conversely, patients recognized the potential for time-savings through the utilization of mHealth, viewed active monitoring as nonburdensome, considered mHealth a tool for reducing the communication threshold with their doctor, and expressed willingness to adopt such a platform if they perceived personal or societal relevance. CONCLUSION This study has elucidated which factors are important for successful development of mHealth for patients with cancer. While both barriers and facilitators play a role, patientsâ attitudes were positive toward the implementation of remote digital monitoring, showing promising prospects for future research of mHealth in oncology.

   abstract = {The current public health crisis has highlighted the need to accelerate healthcare innovation. Despite unwavering levels of cooperation among academia, industry, and policy makers, it can still take years to bring a life-saving product to market. There are some obvious limitations, including lack of blinding or masking and small sample size, which render the results less applicable to the real world. Traditional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are lengthy, expensive, and have a low success rate. There is a growing acknowledgement that the current process no longer fully meets the growing healthcare needs. Advances in technology coupled with proliferation of telehealth modalities, sensors, wearable and connected devices have paved the way for a new paradigm. Virtual randomized controlled trials (vRCTs) have the potential to drastically shorten the clinical trial cycle while maximizing patient-centricity, compliance, and recruitment. This new approach can inform clinical trials in real time and with a holistic view of a patientâs health. This paper provides an overview of virtual clinical trials, addressing critical issues, including regulatory compliance, data security, privacy, and ownership. Â© 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {With the advances in wireless communication and Internet of things, wireless body area networks (WBANs) have attracted more and more attention because of the potential in improving the quality of health care services. With the help of WBANs, the user can access the patient's life-critical data generated by miniaturised medical sensors, and remote health care monitoring services are provided. Since the open nature of wireless channel and sensitivity of transmitted information, the security and privacy of such personal data are becoming important issues that must be dealt with. In the past few years, a large number of authentication schemes had been proposed to solve these issues. However, most of the existing schemes are not secure enough. As a step toward this direction, in this study, the authors present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with adaptive resilience of desynchronisation attacks for WBANs, in which lightweight crypto-modules are adopted to pursue the best efficiency. The proposed scheme adopts the pseudonym identity technique to provide user anonymity, and one-way hash chain technique and serial number method are employed to ensure forward secrecy and resist desynchronisation attack, respectively. Analysis and comparison results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves a delicate balance between security and efficiency. Â© The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020},

   abstract = {Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant womenâs monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. Objective: This study aims to understand cliniciansâ and pregnant womenâs perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. Results: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. Conclusions: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy.

   abstract = {With the proliferation of intelligent services and applications authorized by artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things has penetrated into many aspects of our daily lives, and the medical field is no exception. The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect. Experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed algorithm can effectively protect data privacy.  Â© 2021 Lina Ni et al.},

   abstract = {Arrhythmia disorders are the leading cause of death worldwide and are primarily recognized by the patient's irregular cardiac rhythms. Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM). The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed system achieves 99.76% accuracy, which is better than the existing related schemes.  Â© 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {With innovation in persistent technologies, such as wearable sensor gadgets, sensor devices, and wireless ad-hoc communication networks connect everyday life things to the Internet, normally referred to as Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is observed as an active entity for design and development of smart and context awareness services and applications in the area of business, science and engineering discipline. These applications and services could vigorously respond to the surroundings transformation and usersâ preference. Developing a scalable system for data analysis, processing and mining of enormous real world based datasets has turned into one of the demanding problems that faces both system research scholars and data management research scholars. Employing big data analytics with IoT technologies is one of the ways for handling the timely analyzing information (i.e., data, events) streams. In this paper, we propose an integrated approach that coalesce IoT systems with big data tools into a holistic platform for real-time and continuous data monitoring and processing. We propose Fog assisted IoT based Smart and real time healthcare information processing (SRHIP) system in which large amounts of data generated by IoT sensor devices are offloaded at Fog cloud form data analytics and processing with minimum delay. The processed data is then transferred to a centralized cloud system for further analysis and storage. In this work, we introduce a Fog-assisted model with big data environment for data analytic of real time data with remote monitoring and discuss our plan for evaluating its efficacy in terms of several performance metrics such as transmission cost, storage cost, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and F-measure. The proposed SRHIP system needs less transmission cost of 40.10% in comparison to SPPDA, 100% fewer bytes are compromised in comparison to GCEDA. Our proposed system data size reduction of 60% reduction due to proposed compression scheme in comparison to other benchmark strategies that offer 40% of reduction. Â© 2020},

   abstract = {Background: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a boost in the digital transformation of the human society, where wearable devices such as a smartwatch can already measure vital signs in a continuous and naturalistic way; however, the security and privacy of personal data is a challenge to expanding the use of these data by health professionals in clinical follow-up for decision-making. Similar to the European General Data Protection Regulation, in Brazil, the Lei Geral de ProteÃ§Ã£o de Dados established rules and guidelines for the processing of personal data, including those used for patient care, such as those captured by smartwatches. Thus, in any telemonitoring scenario, there is a need to comply with rules and regulations, making this issue a challenge to overcome. Objective: This study aimed to build a digital solution model for capturing data from wearable devices and making them available in a safe and agile manner for clinical and research use, following current laws. Methods: A functional model was built following the Brazilian Lei Geral de ProteÃ§Ã£o de Dados (2018), where data captured by smartwatches can be transmitted anonymously over the Internet of Things and be identified later within the hospital. A total of 80 volunteers were selected for a 24-week follow-up clinical trial divided into 2 groups, one group with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 and a control group without a previous diagnosis of COVID-19, to measure the synchronization rate of the platform with the devices and the accuracy and precision of the smartwatch in out-of-hospital conditions to simulate remote monitoring at home. Results: In a 35-week clinical trial, >11.2 million records were collected with no system downtime; 66% of continuous beats per minute were synchronized within 24 hours (79% within 2 days and 91% within a week). In the limit of agreement analysis, the mean differences in oxygen saturation, diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate were -1.280% (SD 5.679%), -1.399 (SD 19.112) mm Hg, -1.536 (SD 24.244) mm Hg, and 0.566 (SD 3.114) beats per minute, respectively. Furthermore, there was no difference in the 2 study groups in terms of data analysis (neither using the smartwatch nor the gold-standard devices), but it is worth mentioning that all volunteers in the COVID-19 group were already cured of the infection and were highly functional in their daily work life. Conclusions: On the basis of the results obtained, considering the validation conditions of accuracy and precision and simulating an extrahospital use environment, the functional model built in this study is capable of capturing data from the smartwatch and anonymously providing it to health care services, where they can be treated according to the legislation and be used to support clinical decisions during remote monitoring.

   abstract = {Background: The use of wearable sensor technology to collect patient health data, such as gait and physical activity, offers the potential to transform healthcare research. To maximise the use of wearable devices in practice, it is important that they are usable by, and offer value to, all stakeholders. Although previous research has explored participantsâ opinions of devices, to date, limited studies have explored the experiences and opinions of the researchers who use and implement them. Researchers offer a unique insight into wearable devices as they may have access to multiple devices and cohorts, and thus gain a thorough understanding as to how and where this area needs to progress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences and opinions of researchers from academic, industry and clinical contexts, in the use of wearable devices to measure gait and physical activity. Methods: Twenty professionals with experience using wearable devices in research were recruited from academic, industry and clinical backgrounds. Independent, semi-structured interviews were conducted, audio-recorded and transcribed. Transcribed texts were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) The positives and negatives of using wearable devices in research, (2) The routine implementation of wearable devices into research and clinical practice, (3) The importance of compromise in protocols, (4) Securing good quality data, and (5) A paradigm shift. Researchers overwhelmingly supported the use of wearable sensor technology due to the insights that they may provide. Though barriers remain, researchers were pragmatic towards these, believing that there is a paradigm shift happening in this area of research that ultimately requires mistakes and significant volumes of further research to allow it to progress. Conclusions: Multiple barriers to the use of wearable devices in research and clinical practice remain, including data management and clear clinical utility. However, researchers strongly believe that the potential benefit of these devices to support and create new clinical insights for patient care, is greater than any current barrier. Multi-disciplinary research integrating the expertise of both academia, industry and clinicians is a fundamental necessity to further develop wearable devices and protocols that match the varied needs of all stakeholders.

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyberâphysical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patientâs Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangleâs Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patientâs gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patientâs BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.

   abstract = {The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an emerging technology that combines the Internet of Things (IoT) into the healthcare sector, which brings remarkable benefits to facilitate remote patient monitoring and reduce treatment costs. As IoMT devices become more scalable, Smart Healthcare Systems (SHS) have become increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. An IDS monitors systems or networks for suspicious activities or potential threats, safeguarding internal networks. This paper presents the development of an IDS based on deep learning techniques utilizing benchmark datasets. We propose a multilayer perceptron-based framework for intrusion detection within the smart healthcare domain. The primary objective of our work is to protect smart healthcare devices and networks from malicious attacks and security risks. We employ the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection datasets to evaluate our proposed security framework. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 95.0674%, surpassing that of comparable deep learning models in smart healthcare while also reducing the false positive rate. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of using a multilayer perceptron, achieving superior performance against cybersecurity threats in the smart healthcare domain.

But when patients use medical devices in their homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. Methods: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device. In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy. Conclusions: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the participantsâ perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the study team. Â© The Author(s) 2023.},

   abstract = {IoT has seen remarkable growth, particularly in healthcare, leading to the rise of IoMT. IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications. Â© 2024 by the authors.},

Because of the unexpected increase in the number of diabetes patients, it is critical to regularly evaluate patients' health conditions before any significant illness occurs. As a result of transmitting a large volume of sensitive medical data, dealing with IoT data security issues remains a difficult challenge. This paper presents a secure remote diabetes monitoring (SR-DM) model that uses hybrid encryption, combining the advanced encryption standard and elliptic curve cryptography (AES-ECC), to ensure the patients' sensitive data is protected in IoT platforms based on the cloud. The health statuses of patients are determined in this model by predicting critical situations using machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing medical data sensed by smart health IoT devices. The results reveal that the AES-ECC approach has a significant influence on cloud-based IoT systems and the random forest (RF) classification method outperforms with a high accuracy of 91.4%. As a consequence of the outcomes obtained, the proposed model effectively establishes a secure and efficient system for remote health monitoring.

In a short period, real-time applications for healthcare monitoring produce a huge amount of data. Data is to be bursting in the case of critical applications; hence there is a greater need to enable reliable communication methods that ensure energy efficiency. A large amount of data results in high data transmission, network congestion, and latency, which in turn cause a hop increment between the IoT and cloud servers, and thus data might be unprocessed and insufficient for end-users. Since Fog computing is a distributed intermediate layer between the edge network and the cloud environment, latency can be reduced to a remarkable level, and the reliable communication can be achieved with the help of fog computing on IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. This research proposes a dynamic model for analysis and the Heuristic Hybrid Time Slot Fuzzy-Allocation Algorithm (HHTSF-AA), which improves health monitoring by indulging IoT assisted wearable sensor platform. Fog computing assisted wearable sensor platform is the most suitable and reliable platform for robust life-critical applications that are likely not to be delayed in communication. Besides, routing data packets are equipped with a low-cost energy minimum selection algorithm incorporated to improve the overall network performance.

   abstract = {The use of remote monitoring technology for cardiovascular electronic implantable devices has grown significantly in recent decades, yet several key questions remain about its integration into clinical care. We performed semi-structured interviews of patients, clinicians, and device clinic technicians involved in clinical remote monitoring of cardiovascular implantable devices at our institution. Twenty-eight interviews comprised of 15 patients and 13 clinicians were conducted from October 2019 through February 2020. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a mixed inductive and deductive approach. Perspectives among clinicians and patients varied regarding familiarity, educational experiences, and preferences regarding how remote monitoring data are handled. Three key domains emerged including knowledge and understanding, managing alerts, and cost transparency. Within these domains, key findings includedvery limited understanding of how remote monitoring functions and how alerts in particular are handled. These knowledge deficits (both patients and providers) appeared to arise in part from different equipment and platforms among manufacturers, the complexity of the technology, and lack of formalized education in remote monitoring. However, interviewees expressed generally high levels of trust in the technology and care systems supporting remote monitoring. Few respondents described concerns around cybersecurity, but patients in particular did raise concerns about cost transparency and frequent billing. In conclusion, conflicting perceptions around remote monitoring persist and indicate important knowledge gaps despite high trust in the care pathway. This qualitative analysis offers insight into patient and clinician understanding of and attitudes toward remote monitoring, and may guide future efforts to improve education and patient-centeredness of remote monitoring.

But grouping, traversing and selectively tapping the IoMT data traffic and its immediacy makes data management & decision analysis a pressing issue. Evidently, the selection process for real-world, time-constrained health problems involves looking at multivariate time-series data generated simultaneously from various wearables resulting in data overload and accuracy issues. Computational intelligence of edge analytics can extend predictive capability by quickly turning digital biomarker data into actions for remote monitoring and trigger alarm during emergency incidents without relying on backend servers. But the pervasive generation of data streams from IoMT levies significant issues in data visualization and exploratory data analysis. This paper presents a genetically optimized Fuzzy C-means data clustering technique for affective state recognition on the edge. Clustering segregates the biomarker data in chunks and generates a summarized data for each subject which is then genetically optimized to avoid stagnation in local optima. A multi-level convolution neural network is finally used to classify the affective states into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The model is evaluated on the publicly available WESAD dataset and compares favorably to state-of-the-art with less time complexity. It demonstrates the use of data clustering technique for numerosity reduction of real-time data streams in intelligent edge analytics which facilitates fast analysis of affective state of the user.

Recent advancements in information technology and blockchain technology have revolutionized electronic healthcare research and industry. The innovation of miniaturized healthcare sensors for monitoring patient vital signs has improved and secured the human healthcare system. The increase in portable health devices has enhanced the quality of health-monitoring status both at an activity/fitness level for self-health tracking and at a medical level, providing more data to clinicians with potential for earlier diagnosis and guidance of treatment. When sharing personal medical information, data security and comfort are essential requirements for interaction with and collection of electronic medical records. However, it is hard for current systems to meet these requirements because they have inconsistent security policies and access control structures. The new solutions should be directed towards improving data access, and should be managed by the government in terms of privacy and security requirements to ensure the reliability of data for medical purposes. Blockchain paves the way for a revolution in the traditional pharmaceutical industry and benefits from unique features such as privacy and transparency of data. In this paper, we propose a novel platform for monitoring patient vital signs using smart contracts based on blockchain. The proposed system is designed and developed using hyperledger fabric, which is an enterprise-distributed ledger framework for developing blockchain-based applications. This approach provides several benefits to the patients, such as an extensive, immutable history log, and global access to medical information from anywhere at any time. The Libelium e-Health toolkit is used to acquire physiological data. The performance of the designed and developed system is evaluated in terms of transaction per second, transaction latency, and resource utilization using a standard benchmark tool known as Hyperledger Caliper. It is found that the proposed system outperforms the traditional health care system for monitoring patient data. Â© 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patientsâ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patientsâ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS.

   abstract = {Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic
disorders, such as epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use
increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and
health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with
epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use,
demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter
Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020,
adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire,
including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of
apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2%
women; mean age 40.2  15.4 years), 41.6% reported using
health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently
(pedometer 32.1%, exercise app 17.6%) than medical apps (health
insurance 15.1%, menstrual apps 12.2%) or apps designed for
epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3%, seizure calendars 4.6%).
Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9%)
or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3%). A majority
(60.9%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6% of whom had a
positive view. However, only 28.6% had a concrete idea of
telehealth, and only 16.6% reported personal experience with
telehealth. A majority (55%) would attend a teleconsultation
follow-up, and 41.2% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy
and availability were considered equally important by 50.8%,
21.8% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2%
considered data availability more important. Current
health-related app use was independently associated with younger
age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective
COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure
occurrence (vs. seizure freedom 12 months) did not affect
willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic
regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth
views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with
specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence
telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics.
Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically
disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap. German

On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95%.},

Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.},

   abstract = {Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, due to its significance in many computer vision-based applications, requires in-depth and meaningful details from image sequences. Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%. The proposed system is validated via extensive experimentation and should be applicable to many computer-vision based applications such as healthcare monitoring, security systems and assisted living etc.},

Massive data collected by medical and healthcare monitoring sensors in the IoMT involves sensitive patient information. It brings some security challenges to validate the legitimacy of participating entities and protect patient data privacy. A certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme combines encryption and signature that can offer authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability, providing a viable solution to the data privacy issue of the IoMT. However, existing CLSC schemes fail to meet confidentiality or unforgeability, or require expensive computation overhead to perform pairing operations. This article first presents a new CLSC scheme for secure data transmission and better smart services in IoMT, which replaces the signature part with the Schnorr signature. We then give a thorough security proof under the random oracle model. Besides, we elaborately evaluate the performance and security of some existing solutions with our solution. Finally, the experiment results indicate that our solution can achieve a better balance between security and performance than some existing schemes. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, our scheme is more suitable for the IoMT scenario.},

The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.},

IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.},

However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.},

However, there is a risk of incorrect diagnosis when data is tampered with from the cloud or a hospital due to third-party storage services. Most of the existing systems use an owner-centric data integrity verification mechanism, which is not computationally feasible for lightweight wearable-sensor systems because of limited computing capacity and privacy leakage issues. In this regard, we design a 2-step Privacy-Preserving Multidimensional Data Stream (PPMDS) approach based on a cloudlet framework with an Uncertain Data-integrity Optimization (UDO) model and Sparse-Centric SVM (SCS) model. The UDO model enhances health data security with an adaptive cryptosystem called Cloudlet- Nonsquare Encryption Secret Transmission (C-NEST) strategy by avoiding medical disputes during data streaming based on novel signature and key generation strategies. The SCS model effectively classifies incoming queries for easy access to data by solving scalability issues. The cloudlet server measures data integrity and authentication factors to optimize third-party verification burden and computational cost. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed system optimizes average data leakage error rate by 27%, query response time and average data transmission time are reduced by 31%, and average communication-computation cost are reduced by 61% when measured against state-of-the-art approaches.},

There are, however, security and privacy considerations in the transmission of data from these devices to the backend server, and across heterogeneous IoT networks. In this study, we propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme which is based on blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to facilitate seamless and secure transmission of user data (e.g., electronic health record (EHR)-related information) through secured swarm nodes of peer-to-peer communications. BIoTHR refers to the proposed scheme on the private blockchain-assisted EHR management using IoT. Specifically, new blockchain and swarm exchange infrastructures are suggested as a backbone of the proposed scheme to ensure secure and reliable data transmission and timely monitoring of data sent across IoT networks. An autonomous encryption-decryption mechanism is also utilized, along with a dynamic and modular server assistance technology to deploy EHR transmission in a secure manner. Moreover, several swarm-listen, announcement, peer open and peer closing algorithms are incorporated to employ the actual power of pervasive EHR transmission for better e-healthcare service provisioning. The proposed scheme is developed using the open-source tools of GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang. Proposed study simulates a number of heterogeneous IoT-based health sensor nodes, namely, body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, i.e., SPO2, galvanic skin response, and blood glucose in blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework. The results reveal that the proposed scheme, in terms of blockchain-IoT, swarm exchange and EHR transmission, outperforms several peer techniques.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is being adopted widely impacting every sphere around us. IoT enabled health-care is making the way ahead as it enables remote monitoring of health status seamlessly. The health-care industry historically has generated a large volume of data. With the induction of IoT, this volume has gone up drastically. Therefore, the health data is required to be stored properly to make sense of the data. In this paper, we propose cloudlet assisted IoT enabled e-Health framework. This e-Health framework aims to ease real-time data access using cloudlets. In this framework, we propose and implement a health-care data management scheme to store the enormous health data and process the queries for retrieval of the health data by end-users. We have used NoSQL based model to store health data. Performance of the proposed model has been studied in terms of data transmission time, energy consumption, query response time and data packet loss. Finally, by comparing the evaluation results of our proposed model with performances of the traditional cloud storage-based e-Health system, we justified that our proposed model is performing far better than existing cloud-based e-Health solutions.},

Simultaneously, with the aid of numerous equipments, a great number of collected data can be used for disease prediction or diagnosis model establishment. However, the potential patient data leak will also bring privacy and security issues in the interaction period. To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only 2/N times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.},

   abstract = {Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by â 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by â 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.},

   abstract = {Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or things that can communicate and share information. In IoT-enabled Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN), the smart sensing devices share remote patient monitoring data towards central repositories. During medical data aggregation and transmission, security is mandatory to guard against intruders. The main problem in existing base schemes is that complex multiplication operations are used for batch key creation. These schemes are computationally expensive and require huge memory space at the aggregator node (AN). This paper presents a lightweight Secure Aggregation and Transmission Scheme (SATS) for secure and lightweight data computation and transmission. SATS provides a lightweight XOR operation for obtaining batch keys instead of the expensive multiplication operation. Furthermore, the AN Receiving Message Algorithm (ARMA) is presented at the AN to aggregate data generated by sensor nodes. The Receiving Message Extractor (RME) algorithm is presented to decrypt the message and perform batch verification at the Fog-Server. SATS protects against several security threats such as denial of service attacks, the man in the middle attack, and reply attacks. The proposed SATS is simulated by using simulation tool NS 2.35. The results show that SATS provides lightweight data transmission by reducing computation and communication costs.The computation cost of the SATS scheme is 14%, 23% and 59% at AN, and at Fog-Node 6.5%, 21.5% and 51%, and Communication cost 6%, 3%, and 4% at Sensor Node, and at AN 6%, 9%, and 12% better than PPDAS, IDAP, and ASAS respectively. The proposed SATS is compared with relevant schemes and the results show that it provides better storage capacity, computations cost, communications cost, and energy consumption.},
