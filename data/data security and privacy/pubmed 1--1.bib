  abstract = "Background: Telehealth can improve the treatment of chronic
              disorders, such as epilepsy. Telehealth prevalence and use
              increased during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic. However, familiarity with and use of telehealth and
              health-related mobile applications (apps) by persons with
              epilepsy remain unknown. Methods: We investigated telehealth use,
              demographics, and clinical variables within the multicenter
              Epi2020 cross-sectional study. Between October and December 2020,
              adults with epilepsy completed a validated questionnaire,
              including individual questions regarding knowledge and use of
              apps and telehealth. Results: Of 476 included individuals (58.2\%
              women; mean age 40.2 $\pm$ 15.4 years), 41.6\% reported using
              health-related apps. Health apps were used more frequently
              (pedometer 32.1\%, exercise app 17.6\%) than medical apps (health
              insurance 15.1\%, menstrual apps 12.2\%) or apps designed for
              epilepsy (medication reminders 10.3\%, seizure calendars 4.6\%).
              Few used seizure detectors (i.e., apps as medical devices 1.9\%)
              or mobile health devices (fitness bracelet 11.3\%). A majority
              (60.9\%) had heard the term telehealth, 78.6\% of whom had a
              positive view. However, only 28.6\% had a concrete idea of
              telehealth, and only 16.6\% reported personal experience with
              telehealth. A majority (55\%) would attend a teleconsultation
              follow-up, and 41.2\% would in a medical emergency. Data privacy
              and availability were considered equally important by 50.8\%,
              21.8\% considered data privacy more important, and 20.2\%
              considered data availability more important. Current
              health-related app use was independently associated with younger
              age (p = 0.003), higher education (p < 0.001), and subjective
              COVID-19-related challenges (p = 0.002). Persistent seizure
              occurrence (vs. seizure freedom $\geq$12 months) did not affect
              willingness to use teleconsultations on multivariable logistic
              regression analysis. Conclusions: Despite positive telehealth
              views, few persons with epilepsy in Germany are familiar with
              specific apps or services. Socioeconomic factors influence
              telehealth use more than baseline epilepsy characteristics.
              Telehealth education and services should target socioeconomically
              disadvantaged individuals to reduce the digital care gap. German
