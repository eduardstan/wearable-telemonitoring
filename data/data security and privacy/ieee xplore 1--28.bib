  abstract={Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.},

  abstract={The rise of smart health technologies has offered benefits such as remote patient monitoring, personalized therapy, and early disease detection. However this advancement has also raised concerns about security and privacy of patient data. Authentication is essential for protecting patient data and smart health devices. The existing scheme is identified with security vulnerabilities in terms of stolen verifier, impersonation, and man in middle attacks. Motivated by this, authors have presented a secure, lightweight authentication technique for smart health environments for a remote monitoring scenario employing a Multiple Factor approach and a lightweight algorithm. The scheme is verified through formal and informal analysis. The scheme demonstrated enhanced authentication performance and security with processing overhead of (0.04 milliseconds) and transmission overhead of (704 bits), in comparison to the baseline scheme. This system has the potential to improve data security and privacy in a variety of smart health scenarios.},

  abstract={The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model’s effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.},

  title={FedVAE: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning With Non-IID Private Data}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={17},
  number={3},
  pages={4798-4808},
  abstract={Federated learning (FL), collaboratively training a shared global model without exchanging and centralizing local data, provides a promising solution for privacy preserving. On the other hand, it is faced with two main challenges: First, high communication cost, and second, low model quality due to imbalanced or nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. In this article, we propose FedVAE, an FL framework based on variational autoencoder (VAE) for remote patient monitoring. FedVAE contains two lightweight VAEs: one for projecting data onto a lower dimensional space with similar distribution so as to alleviate the issues of excessive communication overhead and slow convergence rate caused by non-IID data, and the other for shunning training bias due to imbalanced data distribution through generating minority class samples. In general, the proposed FedVAE can improve the overall performance of FL models while consuming only a small amount of communication bandwidth. The experimental results show that the area under the curve (AUC) value of FedVAE can reach 0.9937, which is even higher than that of the traditional centralized model (0.9931). Besides, fine-tuning the global model with personalization can raise the average AUC to 0.9947. Moreover, compared with vanilla FL, FedVAE shows 0.87% improvement in AUC while reducing communication traffic by at least 95%.},

  abstract={In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is facing several challenges, mainly due to the lack of personal, institutions, and medications in public health systems. Over the past decade, information and communication technology has proved its ability to improve medical quality, reduce costs, and promote data security. Developing countries can exploit these technologies to improve the healthcare process and ensure remote health monitoring, especially in rural areas. The Internet of Things and smart medical devices are widely used to provide remote patient monitoring. Current systems are based on centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases several security and privacy risks. The adoption of a distributed architecture is required to overcome these issues. In this article, we describe a Blockchain-based system for securing Internet-of-Things (IoT) healthcare devices. In addition to data encryption, we propose to use Blockchain technology to enhance security and privacy in healthcare systems. The system is intended to allow remote patient monitoring, particularly for chronic diseases that necessitate regular monitoring. Three important characteristics were taken into account: security, scalability, and processing time. The security concerns are ensured by using the re-encryption proxy in conjunction with Blockchain to encrypt data and control access to it. To ensure Blockchain scalability, data are stored in an InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) off-chain database. We use an Ethereum Blockchain based on proof of authority (PoA) to speed up the data storage. In comparison to existing methods, the experimental system has shown a significant improvement in the security of healthcare systems.},

  abstract={Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, due to its significance in many computer vision-based applications, requires in-depth and meaningful details from image sequences. Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%. The proposed system is validated via extensive experimentation and should be applicable to many computer-vision based applications such as healthcare monitoring, security systems and assisted living etc.},

  abstract={The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES.},

  abstract={The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), which integrates medical sensors with the Internet of Things, is helpful for providing remote diagnosis and real-time decision making. Massive data collected by medical and healthcare monitoring sensors in the IoMT involves sensitive patient information. It brings some security challenges to validate the legitimacy of participating entities and protect patient data privacy. A certificateless signcryption (CLSC) scheme combines encryption and signature that can offer authenticity, confidentiality, and unforgeability, providing a viable solution to the data privacy issue of the IoMT. However, existing CLSC schemes fail to meet confidentiality or unforgeability, or require expensive computation overhead to perform pairing operations. This article first presents a new CLSC scheme for secure data transmission and better smart services in IoMT, which replaces the signature part with the Schnorr signature. We then give a thorough security proof under the random oracle model. Besides, we elaborately evaluate the performance and security of some existing solutions with our solution. Finally, the experiment results indicate that our solution can achieve a better balance between security and performance than some existing schemes. Therefore, in terms of feasibility, our scheme is more suitable for the IoMT scenario.},

  abstract={Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.},

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.},

  abstract={The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) facilitates extensive connections between cyber and physical “things” allowing for effective data fusion and remote patient diagnosis and monitoring. However, there is a risk of incorrect diagnosis when data is tampered with from the cloud or a hospital due to third-party storage services. Most of the existing systems use an owner-centric data integrity verification mechanism, which is not computationally feasible for lightweight wearable-sensor systems because of limited computing capacity and privacy leakage issues. In this regard, we design a 2-step Privacy-Preserving Multidimensional Data Stream (PPMDS) approach based on a cloudlet framework with an Uncertain Data-integrity Optimization (UDO) model and Sparse-Centric SVM (SCS) model. The UDO model enhances health data security with an adaptive cryptosystem called Cloudlet- Nonsquare Encryption Secret Transmission (C-NEST) strategy by avoiding medical disputes during data streaming based on novel signature and key generation strategies. The SCS model effectively classifies incoming queries for easy access to data by solving scalability issues. The cloudlet server measures data integrity and authentication factors to optimize third-party verification burden and computational cost. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed system optimizes average data leakage error rate by 27%, query response time and average data transmission time are reduced by 31%, and average communication-computation cost are reduced by 61% when measured against state-of-the-art approaches.},

This send an outcry for a devoted solution, in the form of an individualized, patient-centric care - IoMT that augments precise disease identifications, decrease in errors, reduction in costs of care through the support of technology, allows patients to direct health information data to doctors,manage drugs, keep Personal Health Records, caters to remote medical supports Care, provides proactive approach to preserving Good Health, improves and Accelerates Clinician Workflows, empowers extreme connectivity due to better automation and perceptions in the DNA of IoMT functions. But IoMT adoption is like a rose with thorns like constraints of increased administrative costs, deficiency of universal data access, present-day electronic medical records. The BCT is used in the framework to overcome the security issues of IoMT through the use of latest encryptions. Furthermore, this framework harnesses the benefits of Block Chain like reduced cost, speed, automation, immutability, near-impossible loss of data, permanence, removal of intermediaries, decentralization of consensus, legitimate access to health data, data safekeeping, accrual-based imbursement mechanisms, and medical supply chain efficacy.

  abstract={The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.},

  abstract={The pervasiveness of newly introduced Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has opened up new opportunities in healthcare systems, for example in facilitating remote patient monitoring. There are, however, security and privacy considerations in the transmission of data from these devices to the backend server, and across heterogeneous IoT networks. In this study, we propose a novel privacy-preserving scheme which is based on blockchain and swarm exchange techniques to facilitate seamless and secure transmission of user data (e.g., electronic health record (EHR)-related information) through secured swarm nodes of peer-to-peer communications. BIoTHR refers to the proposed scheme on the private blockchain-assisted EHR management using IoT. Specifically, new blockchain and swarm exchange infrastructures are suggested as a backbone of the proposed scheme to ensure secure and reliable data transmission and timely monitoring of data sent across IoT networks. An autonomous encryption-decryption mechanism is also utilized, along with a dynamic and modular server assistance technology to deploy EHR transmission in a secure manner. Moreover, several swarm-listen, announcement, peer open and peer closing algorithms are incorporated to employ the actual power of pervasive EHR transmission for better e-healthcare service provisioning. The proposed scheme is developed using the open-source tools of GnuPG, IPFS, and Golang. Proposed study simulates a number of heterogeneous IoT-based health sensor nodes, namely, body temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, i.e., SPO2, galvanic skin response, and blood glucose in blockchain-assisted swarm exchange framework. The results reveal that the proposed scheme, in terms of blockchain-IoT, swarm exchange and EHR transmission, outperforms several peer techniques.},

  abstract={Smart homecare utilises advanced technologies to support, improve and promote remote healthcare in homes and communities through collecting and analysing health data and sharing this knowledge with carers and clinicians. With the continuous growth in the world’s older population, smart homecare becomes increasingly crucial in providing in-home care for older adults, allowing the vital healthcare dollars to go further into other critical care needs. In addition, with the rise in the development and utilisation of innovative technologies in healthcare settings, it is vital to ensure that these technologies are guided and approved by the corresponding regulatory bodies such as FDA (Foods and Drug Administration) in the USA and TGA (Therapeutic Good Administration) in Australia. With this premise, this paper identifies four dimensions for researchers to consider when developing smart homecare solutions for in-home remote care: Technology, Data, People, and Operational Environment. The essential interplays amongst these four dimensions are discussed to identify the various enablers and barriers in the successful delivery of smart homecare solutions. As the primary output of this paper, it proposes a conceptual framework to achieve practical in-home care for the older population living independently with the support of technology, while addressing the challenges such as security and privacy of patient data. Secondly, a comprehensive and practical guide featuring seven phases is presented to support and direct researchers in implementing smart homecare solutions for remote care. The proposed framework and the guide aim to make smart homecare research practical and truly translational into broader practice.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is being adopted widely impacting every sphere around us. IoT enabled health-care is making the way ahead as it enables remote monitoring of health status seamlessly. The health-care industry historically has generated a large volume of data. With the induction of IoT, this volume has gone up drastically. Therefore, the health data is required to be stored properly to make sense of the data. In this paper, we propose cloudlet assisted IoT enabled e-Health framework. This e-Health framework aims to ease real-time data access using cloudlets. In this framework, we propose and implement a health-care data management scheme to store the enormous health data and process the queries for retrieval of the health data by end-users. We have used NoSQL based model to store health data. Performance of the proposed model has been studied in terms of data transmission time, energy consumption, query response time and data packet loss. Finally, by comparing the evaluation results of our proposed model with performances of the traditional cloud storage-based e-Health system, we justified that our proposed model is performing far better than existing cloud-based e-Health solutions.},

  abstract={The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) stimulates the innovation for the health-related devices such as remote patient monitoring, connected inhalers and ingestible sensors. Simultaneously, with the aid of numerous equipments, a great number of collected data can be used for disease prediction or diagnosis model establishment. However, the potential patient data leak will also bring privacy and security issues in the interaction period. To deal with these existing issues, we propose a decentralized, efficient, and privacy-enhanced federated edge learning system called DEEP-FEL, which enables medical devices in different institutions to collaboratively train a global model without raw data mutual exchange. Firstly, we design a hierarchical ring topology to alleviate centralization of the conventional training framework, and formulate the ring construction as an optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient heuristic algorithm. Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only $2/N$ times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model. Finally, experimental results on three medical datasets demonstrate the superiority of our system.},

  year={2021},
  volume={4},
  number={4},
  pages={60-66},
  abstract={Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.},

  year={2021},
  volume={39},
  number={2},
  pages={346-360},
  abstract={Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.},

  pages={33571-33585},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects or things that can communicate and share information. In IoT-enabled Wireless Medical Sensor Network (WMSN), the smart sensing devices share remote patient monitoring data towards central repositories. During medical data aggregation and transmission, security is mandatory to guard against intruders. The main problem in existing base schemes is that complex multiplication operations are used for batch key creation. These schemes are computationally expensive and require huge memory space at the aggregator node (AN). This paper presents a lightweight Secure Aggregation and Transmission Scheme (SATS) for secure and lightweight data computation and transmission. SATS provides a lightweight XOR operation for obtaining batch keys instead of the expensive multiplication operation. Furthermore, the AN Receiving Message Algorithm (ARMA) is presented at the AN to aggregate data generated by sensor nodes. The Receiving Message Extractor (RME) algorithm is presented to decrypt the message and perform batch verification at the Fog-Server. SATS protects against several security threats such as denial of service attacks, the man in the middle attack, and reply attacks. The proposed SATS is simulated by using simulation tool NS 2.35. The results show that SATS provides lightweight data transmission by reducing computation and communication costs.The computation cost of the SATS scheme is 14%, 23% and 59% at AN, and at Fog-Node 6.5%, 21.5% and 51%, and Communication cost 6%, 3%, and 4% at Sensor Node, and at AN 6%, 9%, and 12% better than PPDAS, IDAP, and ASAS respectively. The proposed SATS is compared with relevant schemes and the results show that it provides better storage capacity, computations cost, communications cost, and energy consumption.},
