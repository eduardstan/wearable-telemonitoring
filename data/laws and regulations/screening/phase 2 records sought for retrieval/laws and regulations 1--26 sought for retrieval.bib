   abstract = {Conductive hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in electronic skins and soft wearable sensors, often require maturely regulating of the hydrogel mechanical properties to meet specific demands and work for a long-term or under extreme environment. However, in situ regulation of the mechanical properties of hydrogels is still a challenge, and regular conductive hydrogels will inevitably freeze at subzero temperature and easily dehydrate, which leads to a short service life. Herein, a novel adhesive hydrogel (PAA-Dopa-Zr4+) capable of strain sensing is proposed with antifreezing, nondrying, strong surface adhesion, and tunable mechanical properties. 3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-Dopa)-grafted poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and Zr4+ ion are introduced into the hydrogel, which broadly alters the mechanical properties via tuning the in situ aggregation state of polymer chains by ions based on the complexation effect. The catechol groups of l-Dopa and viscous glucose endow the hydrogel with high adhesiveness for skin and device interface (including humid and dry environments) and exhibit an outstanding temperature tolerance under extreme wide temperature spectrum (-35 to 65 °C) or long-lasting moisture retention (60 days). Furthermore, this PAA-Dopa-Zr4+ can be assembled as a flexible strain-sensitive sensor to detect human motions based on specific mechanical properties requirements. This work, enabling superior adhesive and temperature tolerance performance and broad mechanical tenability, presents a new paradigm for numerous applications to wearable sensing and personalized healthcare monitoring.},

   abstract = {Flexible capacitive tactile sensors show great promise in personalized healthcare monitoring and human-machine interfaces, but their practical application is normally hindered because they rarely possess the required comprehensive performance, that is, high pressure sensitivity and fast response within a broad pressure range, high structure robustness, performance consistency, etc. This paper aims to engineer flexible capacitive pressure sensors with highly ordered porous dielectric microstructures and a 3D-printing-based fully solution-processable fabrication process. The proposed dielectric layer with uniformly distributed interior microporous can not only increase its compressibility and dynamic response within an extended pressure range but also enlarge its contact area with electrodes, contributing to a simultaneous improvement in the sensitivity, response speed, detection range, and structure robustness. Meanwhile, owing to its superior abilities in complex structure manufacturing and dimension controlling, the proposed 3D-printing-based fabrication process enables the consistent fabrication of the porous microstructure and thus guarantees device consistency. As a result, the prepared pressure sensors exhibit a high sensitivity of 0.21 kPa-1, fast response and relaxation times of 112 and 152 ms, an interface bonding strength of more than 455.2 kPa, and excellent performance consistency (≤5.47% deviation among different batches of sensors) and tunability. Encouraged by this, the pressure sensor is further integrated with a wireless readout circuit and realizes wireless wearable monitoring of various biosignals (pulse waves and heart rate) and body movements (from slight finger touch to large knee bending). Finally, the influence law of the feature parameters of the porous microstructure on device performance is established by the finite element method, paving the way for sensor optimization. This study motivates the development of flexible capacitive pressure sensors toward practical application. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

Currently, most interactive devices are composed of physically connected separate pressure sensors and display elements, which do not conform to the development of miniaturization and high integration. The realization of combining these two functions in one device with a simplified configuration is still only beginning to be explored. Inspired by the two-in-one response of the octopus, which can both sense and visualize stimuli, an integrated hybrid device based on ionic sensing and electrochromic display is proposed for interactive pressure perception. By efficiently reusing the electrodes and ionic gel, the device enables quantitative sensing and direct color changing in response to pressure. Benefiting from its excellent comprehensive performance, the applications are explored and verified, including the interactive perception of pressure information, hiding and display of visual information under pressure regulation, and repeated writing and erasing on flexible boards. Notably, multiple customized systems with improved design flexibility are implemented to provide remote monitoring and visual warning of behavioral states and physiological parameters.

In nature, different species have their own adaptation system to ambient temperature. Inspired by the army ant nest, herein a thermal adaptive textile known as Army ant Nest Textile (ANT) for thermal management and health monitoring is reported. This textile can promptly respond to perspiration, rapidly absorb sweat, and then transform its architecture to facilitate heat dissipation. Simultaneously, the colorimetric sensing function of ANT allows it to emulate the “site migration” behavior of the army ant nest, which empowers individuals to expeditiously identify multiple health-related signals such as body temperature, UV radiation, and sweat pH values, and warn them to move to a secure environment, thereby effectively reducing the likelihood of physical harm. Together with its excellent scalability and biocompatibility, the ANT offers a promising direction for the development of next-generation smart e-textiles for personal thermal and healthcare management, while satisfying the growing demand for energy saving. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

   abstract = {Recently, one of the primary concerns in e-textile-based healthcare monitoring systems for chronic illness patients has been reducing wasted power consumption, as the system should be always-on to capture diverse biochemical and physiological characteristics. However, the general conductive fibers, a major component of the existing wearable monitoring systems, have a positive gauge-factor (GF) that increases electrical resistance when stretched, so that the systems have no choice but to consume power continuously. Herein, a twisted conductive-fiber-based negatively responsive switch-type (NRS) strain-sensor with an extremely high negative GF (resistance change ratio ≈ 3.9 × 108) that can significantly increase its conductivity from insulating to conducting properties is developed. To this end, a precision cracking technology is devised, which could induce a difference in the Young's modulus of the encapsulated layer on the fiber through selective ultraviolet-irradiation treatment. Owing to this technology, the NRS strain-sensors can allow for effective regulation of the mutual contact resistance under tensile strain while maintaining superior durability for over 5000 stretching cycles. For further practical demonstrations, three healthcare monitoring systems (E-fitness pants, smart-masks, and posture correction T-shirts) with near-zero standby power are also developed, which opens up advancements in electronic textiles by expanding the utilization range of fiber strain-sensors. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

   abstract = {Background: Despite high blood pressure being the leading preventable risk factor for death, only 1 in 3 patients achieve target blood pressure control. Key contributors to this problem are clinical inertia and uncertainties in relying on clinic blood pressure measurements to make treatment decisions. Methods: The NEXTGEN-BP open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial will investigate the efficacy, safety, acceptability and cost-effectiveness of a wearable blood pressure monitor-based care strategy for the treatment of hypertension, compared to usual care, in lowering clinic blood pressure over 12 months. NEXTGEN-BP will enroll 600 adults with high blood pressure, treated with 0 to 2 antihypertensive medications. Participants attending primary care practices in Australia will be randomized 1:1 to the intervention of a wearable-based remote care strategy or to usual care. Participants in the intervention arm will undergo continuous blood pressure monitoring using a wrist-wearable cuffless device (Aktiia, Switzerland) and participate in 2 telehealth consultations with their primary care practitioner (general practitioner [GP]) at months 1 and 2. Antihypertensive medication will be up-titrated by the primary care practitioner at the time of telehealth consults should the percentage of daytime blood pressure at target over the past week be <90%, if clinically tolerated. Participants in the usual care arm will have primary care consultations according to usual practice. The primary outcome is the difference between intervention and control in change in clinic systolic blood pressure from baseline to 12 months. Secondary outcomes will be assessed at month 3 and month 12, and include acceptability to patients and practitioners, cost-effectiveness, safety, medication adherence and patient engagement. Conclusions: NEXTGEN-BP will provide evidence for the effectiveness and safety of a new paradigm of wearable cuffless monitoring in the management of high blood pressure in primary care.

This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment.},

   abstract = {Assessment of expertise development during training program primarily consists of evaluating interactions between task characteristics, performance, and mental load. Such a traditional assessment framework may lack consideration of individual characteristics when evaluating training on complex tasks, such as driving and piloting, where operators are typically required to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. Studies have already identified individual characteristics arising from intrinsic, context, strategy, personality, and preference as common predictors of performance and mental load. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of individual difference in skill acquisition and transfer using an ecologically valid dual task, behavioral, and brain activity measures. Specifically, we implemented a search and surveillance task (scanning and identifying targets) using a high-fidelity training simulator for the unmanned aircraft sensor operator, acquired behavioral measures (scan, not scan, over scan, and adaptive target find scores) using simulator-based analysis module, and measured brain activity changes (oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin) from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) using a portable functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) sensor array. The experimental protocol recruited 13 novice participants and had them undergo three easy and two hard sessions to investigate skill acquisition and transfer, respectively. Our results from skill acquisition sessions indicated that performance on both tasks did not change when individual differences were not accounted for. However inclusion of individual differences indicated that some individuals improved only their scan performance (Attention-focused group), while others improved only their target find performance (Accuracy-focused group). Brain activity changes during skill acquisition sessions showed that mental load decreased in the right anterior medial PFC (RAMPFC) in both groups regardless of individual differences. However, mental load increased in the left anterior medial PFC (LAMPFC) of Attention-focused group and decreased in the Accuracy-focused group only when individual differences were included. Transfer results showed no changes in performance regardless of grouping based on individual differences; however, mental load increased in RAMPFC of Attention-focused group and left dorsolateral PFC (LDLPFC) of Accuracy-focused group. Efficiency and involvement results suggest that the Attention-focused group prioritized the scan task, while the Accuracy-focused group prioritized the target find task. In conclusion, training on multitasks results in individual differences. These differences may potentially be due to individual preference. Future studies should incorporate individual differences while assessing skill acquisition and transfer during multitask training.},

These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods. © 2022},

However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party.

   abstract = {This article presents an area and power-efficient system-on-chip (SoC) for vital signs monitoring to provide patients with remote monitoring. It measures five important vitals including blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and temperature. The proposed SoC utilizes a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal to compute HR, HRV, SpO2, and RR. The PPG signal is amplified and filtered using a PPG readout that includes a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a switched integrator (SI) to filter and amplify the signal. A differential second-order, delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter ( ΔΣ -ADC) is adopted to digitize the PPG signal. The SoC also comprises a low-power LED driver for both red and infrared (IR) LEDs which operate in pulsed mode with a 0.625% duty cycle. A vital signs extractor performs feature extraction (FE) and computes the vital signs with a maximum absolute error of less than 1%. In this work, the temperature is also measured by employing a Wheatstone bridge (WhB)-based temperature sensor which integrates thermal resistors into a second-order  ΔΣ -ADC. The proposed system shares  ΔΣ -ADC for digitizing the PPG signal and the temperature readings to reduce both area and power consumption. The proposed system computes the temperature over the human’s temperature range ( 32~^   C to  42~^   C) with an accuracy of +/ - 0.09~^   C. The SoC is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with an area of 4.8 mm2 while consuming  206~μ  W.},

   abstract = {Background: Wearables hold potential to improve chronic disease self-management in conditions like cystic fibrosis (CF) through remote monitoring, early detection of illness and motivation. Little is known about the acceptability and sustainability of integrating wearables into routine care from the perspectives of people with CF (pwCF) and their treating clinicians. Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews with adult pwCF and focus groups comprising members of a CF multidisciplinary team (MDT) were conducted at a specialist CF centre in Australia. A phenomenological orientation underpinned the study. Inductive thematic analysis was performed using the Framework method. The study adhered to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. Results: Nine pwCF and eight members of a CF MDT, representing six clinical disciplines, participated in the study. Eight themes were inductively generated from the data, of which four were identified from each group. PwCF valued wearables for providing real-time data to motivate healthy behaviours and support shared goal-setting with healthcare providers. Wearables did not influence adherence to CF-specific self-management practices and had some hardware limitations. Members of the CF MDT recognised potential benefits of remote monitoring and shared goal-setting, but advised caution regarding data accuracy, generating patient anxiety in certain personality traits, and lack of evidence supporting use in CF self-management. Conclusions: Perspectives on integrating wearables into CF care were cautiously optimistic, with emerging risks related to patient anxiety and lack of evidence moderating acceptance.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE There is an increasing interest in studying the potential of mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as smartphone apps and wearables, as monitoring tools for patients with cancer during or after their treatment. However, little research is dedicated to exploring the opinions and concerns of patients regarding the adoption of these technologies. This study aimed to gain insight into patients’ perspectives and preferences for participating in mHealth-based monitoring in cancer care. METHODS A qualitative study comprising semistructured interviews was conducted in the Netherlands between April and June 2023. Participants were eligible if they were 18 years or older with a current or past diagnosis of cancer. The interview guide was developed on the basis of the technology acceptance model, with main themes being use, communication, trust, privacy, and expectations. RESULTS Thirteen participants with urologic primary cancer were interviewed. Most patients had already some familiarity with the use of digital monitoring devices or wearables. Main barriers included persistent reminders of the illness, receiving notifications deemed unnecessary or unwanted, and the acknowledgment that mHealth technology does not serve as a substitute for human doctors. Conversely, patients recognized the potential for time-savings through the utilization of mHealth, viewed active monitoring as nonburdensome, considered mHealth a tool for reducing the communication threshold with their doctor, and expressed willingness to adopt such a platform if they perceived personal or societal relevance. CONCLUSION This study has elucidated which factors are important for successful development of mHealth for patients with cancer. While both barriers and facilitators play a role, patients’ attitudes were positive toward the implementation of remote digital monitoring, showing promising prospects for future research of mHealth in oncology.},

The pandemic has forced treatment providers and facilities to rapidly adapt to address these threats while redesigning their structure to accommodate physical distancing regulations. Digital health interventions can function without the need for physical proximity. Clinicians can use digital health intervention, such as telehealth, wearables, mobile applications, and other remote monitoring devices, to convert in-person care to remote-based care, and they can leverage these tools to address some of the pandemic-specific challenges to treatment. The current pandemic provides the opportunity to rapidly explore the advantages and limitations of these technologies in the care of individuals with SUD.},

   abstract = {Conductive hydrogels have emerged as promising material candidates for multifunctional strain sensors, attributed to their similarity to biological tissues, good wearability, and high accuracy of information acquisition. However, it is difficult to simultaneously manufacture conductive hydrogel-based multifunctional strain sensors with the synergistic properties of reliable healability for long-term usage and environmental degradability/recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. This work reports a facile strategy to engineer a self-healing, recyclable and conductive strain sensor by virtue of molecular-level multi-dynamic interactions (MMDIs) including Schiff base complexes, hydrogen bonds, and coordination bonds, which were fabricated using a dialdehyde TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetra-methylpiperidine-1-oxyl)-oxidized nanofibrillated cellulose (DATNFC) pre-reinforced gelatin nanocomposite hydrogel (gelatin/DATNFC hydrogel, GDH) followed by dipping in an Fe3+ aqueous solution. The MMDI strategy allows synchronous regulation of both bulk and interfacial interactions to obtain exciting properties that outperform those of conventional hydrogels, including extraordinary compressive stress (1310 kPa), intriguing self-healing abilities, and remarkable electrical conductivity. With these outstanding merits, the as-prepared gelatin/DATNFC/Fe3+ hydrogel (GDIH) is developed to be a multifunctional strain sensor with appealing strain sensitivity (GF = 2.24 under 6% strain) and compressive sensitivity (S = 1.14 kPa-1 under 15 kPa), which can be utilized to manufacture electronic skin and accurately discern subtle bodily motions, handwriting and personal signatures. Notably, this GDIH-based sensor also exhibited reliable self-healing properties for long-term usage, environmental degradability and complete recyclability for decreasing the electronic waste. In consideration of the extremely facile preparation process, biocompatibility, satisfactory functionalities, remarkable self-healing properties and recyclability, the emergence of the GDIH-based sensor is believed to propose a new strategy for the development of sustainable-multifunctional strain sensors and healthcare monitoring. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.},

Our analysis of health privacy laws indicates that most US patients may have little access to their own digital health data in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act grant greater access to device-collected data. Our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Context: Millions of life-sustaining implantable devices collect and relay massive amounts of digital health data, increasingly by using user-downloaded smartphone applications to facilitate data relay to clinicians via manufacturer servers. Whether patients have either legal or normative claims to data collected by these devices, particularly in the raw, granular format beyond that summarized in their medical records, remains incompletely explored. Methods: Using pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) as a clinical model, we outline the clinical ecosystem of data collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation. We consider the legal implications of US and European privacy regulations for patient access to either summary or raw device data. Lastly, we evaluate ethical arguments for or against providing patients access to data beyond the summaries presented in medical records. Findings: Our analysis of applicable health privacy laws indicates that US patients may have little access to their raw data collected and held by device manufacturers in the United States under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy Rule, whereas the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) grants greater access to device-collected data when the processing of personal data falls under the GDPR's territorial scope. The California Consumer Privacy Act, the “little sister” of the GDPR, also grants greater rights to California residents. By contrast, our normative analysis argues for consistently granting patients access to the raw data collected by their implantable devices. Smartphone applications are increasingly involved in the collection, relay, retrieval, and documentation of these data. Therefore, we argue that smartphone user agreements are an emerging but potentially underutilized opportunity for clarifying both legal and ethical claims for device-derived data. Conclusions: Current health privacy legislation incompletely supports patients’ normative claims for access to digital health data.},

However, the 3D printing of unique architectures and arbitrary shapes could endow the conformal electronic sensors with excellent flexibility and functionality. In this work, the self-poled PENG were successfully fabricated by incorporating the oriented ionic salt-montmorillonite (IS-MMT) co-fillers into poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) matrix and then performing 3D printing. This hence could give the 3D printed PENG the locked interfacial piezoelectric polarization. More importantly, the self-adaptive conformal PENG based on auxetic metamaterial has also been developed, which is beyond the practicability of the traditional 2D PENG. The effect of various architectures of the metamaterial on the mechanical and piezoelectric responses was particularly discussed. The tailoring of the 3D printed cell with metamaterial of serpentine geometries shows the appealing advantages of high sensitivity to structure variation, thus being beneficial for easier regulation of piezoelectric output. When mounted on the joints as a wearable healthcare monitoring device, this 3D printed PENG could accurately detect the movement of muscles, demonstrating its potential in motion tracking and sign-language interpretation. Obviously, this work could provide a new idea for design and fabrication of programmable wearable electronics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Results show that, in general, participants experienced the biocueing application as positive and are willing to use biocueing. This is an important finding since forensic patients are often unmotivated to engage with therapeutic techniques. An exploration of trends in aggression and self-harm prior to and during the use of biocueing showed no significant changes.

FNSD has a complex biopsychosocial aetiology but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Remote monitoring technologies (RMT) could provide critical insights into functional neurological symptoms (FNS) in real-world contexts. We examined the feasibility and acceptability of a novel RMT protocol, to identify psychobiological correlates and antecedents of FNS in everyday life. Seventeen individuals with FNS (seizures/motor) and 17 healthy controls (HC) completed ecological momentary assessments (EMA) eight times daily for 1-week, reporting FNS severity, associated physical and psychological symptoms, and subjectively significant events. Sleep quality was reported daily. Physiological variables were measured using wearable Fitbit 5 devices. Multilevel modelling examined variables associated with FNS variability. Average EMA completion rates were good in both groups (≥80%). At week-level, the FNS group reported significantly greater subjective arousal, pain, fatigue, dissociation, negative affect, daily events, stressful events, and sleep duration, compared to HC. Objective sleep disturbance and duration, and resting heartrate, were also significantly greater in the FNS sample. FNS severity correlated significantly with daily events, affect, subjective arousal, pain, fatigue and sleep disturbance, at day- or within-day levels. Daily events and negative affect were the most prominent time-lagged predictors of within-day moment-to-moment FNS severity. RMTs are feasible and acceptable tools for investigation of FNS in real-world settings, revealing daily events and negative affect as possible triggers of FNS. Interventions targeting affective reactivity and regulation might be beneficial in this group. Larger-scale, longer-term RMT studies are needed in this population. © 2024 The Author(s)},

   abstract = {Remote patient-monitoring systems are helpful since they can provide timely and effective healthcare facilities. Such online telemedicine is usually achieved with the help of sophisticated and advanced wearable sensor technologies. The modern type of wearable connected devices enable the monitoring of vital sign parameters such as: heart rate variability (HRV) also known as electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BLP), Respiratory rate and body temperature, blood pressure (BLP), respiratory rate, and body temperature. The ubiquitous problem of wearable devices is their power demand for signal transmission; such devices require frequent battery charging, which causes serious limitations to the continuous monitoring of vital data. To overcome this, the current study provides a primary report on collecting kinetic energy from daily human activities for monitoring vital human signs. The harvested energy is used to sustain the battery autonomy of wearable devices, which allows for a longer monitoring time of vital data. This study proposes a novel type of stress- or exercise-monitoring ECG device based on a microcontroller (PIC18F4550) and a Wi-Fi device (ESP8266), which is cost-effective and enables real-time monitoring of heart rate in the cloud during normal daily activities. In order to achieve both portability and maximum power, the harvester has a small structure and low friction. Neodymium magnets were chosen for their high magnetic strength, versatility, and compact size. Due to the non-linear magnetic force interaction of the magnets, the non-linear part of the dynamic equation has an inverse quadratic form. Electromechanical damping is considered in this study, and the quadratic non-linearity is approximated using MacLaurin expansion, which enables us to find the law of motion for general case studies using classical methods for dynamic equations and the suitable parameters for the harvester. The oscillations are enabled by applying an initial force, and there is a loss of energy due to the electromechanical damping. A typical numerical application is computed with Matlab 2015 software, and an ODE45 solver is used to verify the accuracy of the method. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Recently, wearable pressure sensors have attracted tremendous attention because of their potential applications in intelligent equipment and flexible electronic. Aside from efficient real-time sensing performances, the wearing experience such as comfort and lightweight are also quite important for human health-care monitoring devices or systems. Effectively regulating radiative heating from human body are of interest for improving thermal comfort with a cost-effective approach. Here, we report a new strategy utilizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as both pressure sensing layer and infrared reflector for fabricating multifunctional wearable electronic device. The as-fabricated device based on face to face structure shows ultrahigh sensitivity of 5.22×105 kPa−1 at 0–30 kPa, and 6.06×104 kPa−1 at 30−100 kPa, respectively. Meanwhile, both measured spectra and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation results demonstrate that such multifunctional devices present an extreme low IR emissivity of ∼ 20 % as well as outstanding self-warming capability. As a result, it not only shows a passive warming effect of 6 °C over the commercial cotton pieces but also exhibits an outstanding Joule heating effect. This approach will promote the development of multifunctional flexible electronic in personal healthcare, thermal regulation and lightweight body armor applications for effective energy savings. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},
