  abstract={Medical Internet of Things technology can effectively enable remote physiological data collection, monitoring, and transmission by integrating flexible sensors, wireless communication, and the human body in a wearable and embedded manner. Herein, a stretchable elastomer optical fiber has been developed and sandwiched with two performance of polymethyl methacrylate optical fibers to form a fully flexible polymer optical fiber sensor. The optical fiber integrated with the system mainly consists of a microcomputer, a light-emitting diode (LED) driver, a LED light source, a photodiode, and a Bluetooth module. One intelligent wearable photonic sensing system has been developed based on the Beer–Lambert law of the stretchable elastomer optical fiber for remote healthcare monitoring. Benefiting from the use of elastomer polymer materials, the sensing system features a maximum strain of more than 250%, a high-tensile strain of up to 100%, and a durability of >500 tests. Also, based on the advantage of elastomer optical fiber, the sensing part can be flexibly pasted on the skin surface as a wearable device for real-time monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. In this study, we successfully realized the monitoring of breathing pattern, heart rate, pulse, facial micro-activity, and joint activity, and the recognition of articulatory activity and knee joint activity using a 1-D convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of more than 90% for each activity recognition. Such merits demonstrate its potential as a medical toolkit and indicate promise for remote healthcare monitoring.},

  abstract={Near field communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless communication technique that has become an attractive device for healthcare and wellbeing monitoring. The work reported here demonstrates the development of a battery free wearable sensing system with temperature and sweat sensors embedded into and powered by a smart textile NFC antenna. The NFC antenna is seamlessly integrated with closed-body garments, and the sensor data can be easily acquired by NFC readers and smart phones in order to achieve real time and wireless monitor of health status in a convenient and nonintrusive way. A Dickson charge pump circuit has been designed and implemented in order to pump up the voltage and ensure a steady voltage supply for the sweat sensor. The maximum read range for accessing sensor data is 6 cm. The on-body measurement accuracy of the temperature sensor and sweat sensor are able to achieve ±0.14 °C and ±0.2%, respectively.

  title={Wearable Wrist Photoplethysmography for Optimal Monitoring of Vital Signs: A Unified Perspective on Pulse Waveforms}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={14},
  number={2},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring.},

  abstract={This article presents an area and power-efficient system-on-chip (SoC) for vital signs monitoring to provide patients with remote monitoring. It measures five important vitals including blood oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiration rate (RR), heart rate (HR), HR variability (HRV), and temperature. The proposed SoC utilizes a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal to compute HR, HRV, SpO2, and RR. The PPG signal is amplified and filtered using a PPG readout that includes a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a switched integrator (SI) to filter and amplify the signal. A differential second-order, delta-sigma analog-to-digital converter ( $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC) is adopted to digitize the PPG signal. The SoC also comprises a low-power LED driver for both red and infrared (IR) LEDs which operate in pulsed mode with a 0.625% duty cycle. A vital signs extractor performs feature extraction (FE) and computes the vital signs with a maximum absolute error of less than 1%. In this work, the temperature is also measured by employing a Wheatstone bridge (WhB)-based temperature sensor which integrates thermal resistors into a second-order  $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC. The proposed system shares  $\Delta \Sigma $ -ADC for digitizing the PPG signal and the temperature readings to reduce both area and power consumption. The proposed system computes the temperature over the human’s temperature range ( $32~^{\circ }$  C to  $42~^{\circ }$  C) with an accuracy of +/ $- 0.09~^{\circ }$  C. The SoC is implemented using a 180 nm CMOS process with an area of 4.8 mm2 while consuming  $206~\mu $  W.},

  abstract={With the dramatic increase of the Internet of Medical Things devices, self and remote health data monitoring is consistently receiving more attention. However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party. The results of several stress tests conducted on a real case study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed solution, which shows good scalability and a modest impact on the application performance measured during the decentralized data access.},

  abstract={In the midst of a global health crisis, it is of utmost importance for healthcare technologies to possess the capability to regulate and monitor the physiological variables of patients remotely and automatically. The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient’s MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller’s coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor’s policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate.},
