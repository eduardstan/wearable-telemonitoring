N2  - Background: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI.

N2  - Background: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) is primarily managed at home and can stem from physical exertion and emotional distress triggers. Beyond these triggers, the impact of ambient environment on pain occurrence and intensity has not been investigated. This study explores the impact of environmental factors on the frequency and severity of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in the home context from the perspective of patients with advanced cancer and their primary family caregiver. Methods: A health monitoring system was deployed in the homes of patient and family caregiver dyads to collect self-reported pain events and contextual environmental data (light, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ambient noise.) Correlation analysis examined the relationship between environmental factors with: 1) individually reported pain episodes and 2) overall pain trends in a 24-hour time window. Machine learning models were developed to explore how environmental factors may predict BTCP episodes. Results: Variability in correlation strength between environmental variables and pain reports among dyads was found. Light and noise show moderate association (r = 0.50–0.70) in 66% of total deployments. The strongest correlation for individual pain events involved barometric pressure (r = 0.90); for pain trends over 24-hours the strongest correlations involved humidity (r = 0.84) and barometric pressure (r = 0.83). Machine learning achieved 70% BTCP prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides insights into the role of ambient environmental factors in BTCP and offers novel opportunities to inform personalized pain management strategies, remotely support patients and their caregivers in self-symptom management. This research provides preliminary evidence of the impact of ambient environmental factors on BTCP in the home setting. We utilized real-world data and correlation analysis to provide an understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and cancer pain which may be helpful to others engaged in similar work.

N2  - Background and Objective: The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has revolutionized telemedicine by enabling the remote monitoring and management of patient care. Nevertheless, the process of regeneration presents the difficulty of effectively prioritizing the information of emergency patients in light of the extensive amount of data generated by several integrated health care devices. The main goal of this study is to be improving the procedure of prioritizing emergency patients by implementing the Real-time Triage Optimization Framework (RTOF), an innovative method that utilizes diverse data from the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). Methods: The study's methodology utilized a variety of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) data, such as sensor data and texts derived from electronic medical records. Tier 1 supplies sensor and textual data, and Tier 3 imports textual data from electronic medical records. We employed our methodologies to handle and examine data from a sample of 100,000 patients afflicted with hypertension and heart disease, employing artificial intelligence algorithms. We utilized five machine-learning algorithms to enhance the accuracy of triage. Results: The RTOF approach has remarkable efficacy in a simulated telemedicine environment, with a triage accuracy rate of 98%. The Random Forest algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to the other approaches under scrutiny. The performance characteristics attained were an accuracy rate of 98%, a precision rate of 99%, a sensitivity rate of 98%, and a specificity rate of 100%. The findings show a significant improvement compared to the present triage methods. Conclusions: The efficiency of RTOF surpasses that of existing triage frameworks, showcasing its significant ability to enhance the quality and efficacy of telemedicine solutions. This work showcases substantial enhancements compared to existing triage approaches, while also providing a scalable approach to tackle hospital congestion and optimize resource allocation in real-time. The results of our study emphasize the capacity of RTOF to mitigate hospital overcrowding, expedite medical intervention, and enable the creation of adaptable telemedicine networks. This study highlights potential avenues for further investigation into the integration of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with machine learning to develop cutting-edge medical technologies.

N2  - Background: Hyperkalemia, characterized by elevated serum potassium levels, heightens the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly increasing risk for individuals with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Traditional laboratory test monitoring is resource-heavy, invasive, and unable to provide continuous tracking. Wearable technologies like smartwatches with electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities are emerging as valuable tools for remote monitoring, potentially allowing for personalized monitoring with artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG interpretation. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop an AI-ECG algorithm to predict serum potassium level in ESRD patients with smartwatch-generated ECG waveforms. Methods: A cohort of 152,508 patients with 293,557 ECGs paired serum potassium levels obtained within 1 hour at Cedars Sinai Medical Center was used to train an AI-ECG model (“Kardio-Net”) to predict serum potassium level. The model was further fine-tuned on 4,337 ECGs from 1,463 patients with ESRD using inputs from 12- and single-lead ECGs. Kardio-Net was evaluated in held-out test cohorts from Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Stanford Healthcare (SHC) as well as a prospective international cohort of 40 ESRD patients with smartwatch ECGs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Results: The Kardio-Net, when applied to 12-lead ECGs, identified severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) with an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.745-0.956) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.527 mEq/L. In external validation at SHC, the model achieved an AUC of 0.849 (95% CI: 0.823-0.875) and an MAE of 0.599 mEq/L. For single-lead ECGs, Kardio-Net detected severe hyperkalemia with an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.765-0.987) in the primary cohort and had an MAE of 0.575 mEq/L. In the external SHC validation, the AUC was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.778-0.835) with an MAE of 0.740 mEq/L. Using prospectively obtained smartwatch data, the AUC was 0.831 (95% CI: 0.693-0.975), with an MAE of 0.580 mEq/L. Conclusions: We validate a deep learning model to predict serum potassium levels from both 12-lead ECGs and single-lead smartwatch data, demonstrating its utility for remote monitoring of hyperkalemia.

N2  - Background: The most recent exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD) classification criteria relies in part on changes in respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Despite this paradigm shift, a thorough understanding of exacerbation patterns is still lacking, as is the identification of physiological exacerbation biomarkers. Methods: Using a convenience sampling approach, this prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 2023 and January 2024. Continuous measurements of daytime/overnight respiratory (primary outcome), cardiovascular, autonomic, activity and sleep-related parameters were collected by a wearable biometric wristband and ring over 21 consecutive days in free-living outpatients experiencing and receiving treatment (≤3 days) for a current exacerbation from the home environment. The EXACT-PRO questionnaire served as the validated reference for daily symptom burden and to identify ‘recovered’ versus ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Unadjusted and adjusted (for age, sex, FEV1) linear mixed-effects models were fitted to estimate associations between each physiological parameter with daily EXACT-PRO score (points, pts), in all, ‘recovered’, and ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Results are presented as point estimates with 95% CIs. Findings: In 21 participants with COPD (43% female, mean age 66.8, BMI 27.7 kg/m2, FEV1 36.3% predicted; 85.7% with GOLD 3–4 disease), significant associations in unadjusted models with daily EXACT-PRO score included RR variability (−1.45 [−2.84, −0.073] pts/breath/min) but not RR, daily step count (−0.56 [−0.82, −0.31] pts/1000 steps), and sleep efficiency (−0.12 [−0.20, −0.037] pts/%asleep). In ‘recovered’ participants (n = 10), significant associations included nighttime HR, movement intensity and nightly SpO2. In ‘persistent worsening’ participants (n = 11), significant associations included HR variability, nightly RR variability, nightly SpO2, sleep efficiency, and skin temperature. Similar results were found in adjusted models. Interpretation: This study provides a prospective continuous characterisation of exacerbations of COPD using remotely collected, ambulatory/free-living data. The physiological patterns presented may contribute to the understanding of exacerbations and may enhance the development of effective remote monitoring solutions.

N2  - The promise of remote patient monitoring (RPM) lies in its ability to revolutionize health care delivery by enabling continuous, real-time tracking of patient health outside traditional clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of RPM, particularly in underserved and rural populations, highlighting both its potential and the persistent barriers that limit its widespread use. This paper explores the critical role of technological advancements-such as wearables, artificial intelligence (AI), and broadband expansion-in sustaining and optimizing RPM in the postpandemic era. We examine Michigan as a microcosm of national health care challenges, focusing on its diverse population and geographic barriers, and propose condition-specific RPM protocols to address these inequities. Key facilitators and barriers to RPM implementation are discussed, with a focus on AI integration, community engagement, and digital infrastructure. We also explore the role of policy reform and public-private partnerships in supporting RPM's scalability and long-term sustainability. Our findings suggest that while RPM offers a powerful tool for improving health care access and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions and rural maternal health, sustained investment in technology and infrastructure is critical. By addressing these challenges, RPM can become a cornerstone of modern health care, reducing disparities and improving care delivery for underserved populations.

N2  - Pregnancies impacted by diabetes face the compounded challenge of strict glycemic control with mounting insulin resistance as the pregnancy progresses. New technological advances, including artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), are revolutionizing healthcare delivery by providing innovative solutions for diabetes care during pregnancy. Together, AI and the IoMT are a multibillion-dollar industry that integrates advanced medical devices and sensors into a connected network that enables continuous monitoring of glucose levels. AI-driven Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) can predict glucose trends and suggest tailor evidenced-based treatments with real-time adjustments as her insulin resistance changes with placental growth. Additionally, mobile health applications (mHealth) facilitate patient education and self-management through real-time tracking of diet, physical activity, and glucose levels. Remote monitoring capabilities are particularly beneficial for pregnant persons with diabetes as they extend quality care to underserved populations and reduce the need for frequent in-person visits. This high-resolution monitoring allows physicians and patients access to an unprecedented wealth of data to make more informed decisions based on real-time data, reducing complications for both the mother and fetus. These technologies can potentially improve maternal and fetal outcomes by enabling timely, individualized interventions based on personalized health data. While AI and IoMT offer significant promise in enhancing diabetes care for improved maternal and fetal outcomes, their implementation must address challenges such as data security, cost-effectiveness, and preserving the essential patient-provider relationship.

N2  - The aim of this pilot study was to assess the compliance of breast cancer (BC) patients with fitness tracker (FT) monitoring program during radiotherapy (RT) and to characterize radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) status through objective evaluation using FT-collected parameters. Thirty-six BC patients were invited to wear FT during their RT course for continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR) and step counts (STP). RIF assessment was performed weekly, according to CTCAE v5.0 and dichotomized into G0 vs. any-grade. A novel concept based on patient Repeated Activity Window (RAW) was introduced to evaluate HR and STP variations during RT. Several Machine Learning (ML) methods were trained to characterize RIF on the basis of HR and STP collected data. RIF of any grade was reported by 17 out of 36 patients (47%) included in the study. None of patient clinical variables were significantly correlated with RIF. All patients accepted the FT monitoring program, and for 32 patients FT collection efficiency was greater than 60%. For each patient, a distinct distribution of RAWs was identifiable over RT and across the entire patient cohort, with a total of 7950 RAWs processed. Six features related to RAWs, HR and STP were identified as associated with RIF. The best-performing classifier was the Bagged Trees model, showing a cross-validated ROC-AUC of 89% (95% CI 88-90%). This study confirms the feasibility of continuous biomedical monitoring of BC patients by FT. We successfully identify objective indicators of RIF through HR and STP variation measures within each patient's RAW, thus providing a novel and practical approach to assess and manage RIF. This can significantly aid medical staff in evaluating RIF trajectories, potentially leading to better individualized care strategies and improved patient outcomes.

N2  - Flexible and stretchable strain sensors have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in various fields including human health monitoring and human-machine interfaces. Previous studies have shown that strain sensors based on microcracks can exhibit both high sensitivity and a wide sensing range by manipulating the opening and closing of randomly generated cracks within conductive thin films. However, the uncontrolled nature of microcrack formation can cause a drift in the sensor's performance over time, affecting its accuracy and reliability. In this study, by pre-defining the cracks, we introduce a novel resistive strain sensor with high sensitivity, excellent linearity, an ultra-low detection limit, and robustness against off-axis deformation. The sensor operates on a simple mechanism involving the modulation of ohmic contact within intricately designed conductive serpentine curves, which are encapsulated by pre-stretched thin films. This design facilitates a high gauge factor of 495, exceptional linearity (R2 > 0.98), and an ultra-low detection threshold of 0.01% strain. Moreover, it maintains performance integrity during off-axis deformations such as bending and twisting, features that are indispensable for accurately monitoring human motion. To explore practical applications, a driving scenario was simulated where a sensor array was positioned on the driver's neck. The sensor output was analyzed using machine learning algorithms to successfully determine the presence of driver fatigue. This demonstration underlines the potential of our sensor technology in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to wearable biomechanical systems and human-machine interfaces.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The widespread adoption of wearables, for example, smartphones and smartwatches in the daily lives of the general population, allows passive monitoring of physiological and behavioural data in the real world. This qualitative study explores the perspective of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients towards these so-called digital biomarkers (dBMs). METHODS: As part of a Design Thinking approach, six focus groups were conducted involving 27 PsA patients. The semistructured topic guide included disease activity, coping strategies, care needs, and potential advantages and disadvantages of dBMs. Thematic analysis followed an abductive coding method. RESULTS: PsA daily permeates patients' lives, both physically and mentally. Participants discussed how their lives are focused on minimising the impact of the disease on their daily routines. Their attempts to gain control over their disease highly depend on trial and error. Flare-ups are related to physiological as well as behavioural micro and macro changes. Understanding these changes could enable the detection of (early) flare. Participants elicited pros and cons of the use of dBMs, discussed their intended use and made practical remarks. This led to three main themes: 'Perceived dBM opportunities', 'Mapping Disease activity' and 'Perceived dBM barriers and pitfalls'. CONCLUSION: PsA patients are receptive to dBMs for tracking the disease symptoms. Disease activity is regarded multifaceted and thus, dBMs should include a broad range of features to truly reflect the disease activity status. Reducing the time of trial and error in learning to manage the disease is regarded beneficial. Establishing and maintaining the relationship with their attending physicians is a prerequisite, even if remote patient monitoring becomes an alternative for some physical hospital visits.

N2  - Background/Objectives: Early identification of complications in chronic and infectious diseases can reduce clinical deterioration, lead to early therapeutic interventions and lower morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we aimed to assess the feasibility of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the automatic generation of alerts through remote patient monitoring and to identify the patient profile associated with the likelihood of severe medical alerts. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 in home isolation were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional primary care telephone follow-up plus access to a mobile app for self-reporting of symptoms (control group) or conventional primary care telephone follow-up plus access to the mobile app for self-reporting of symptoms and wearable devices for real-time telemonitoring of vital signs (case group). Results: A total of 342 patients were randomized, of whom 247 were included in the per-protocol analysis (103 cases and 144 controls). The case group received a more exhaustive follow-up, with a higher number of alerts (61,827 vs. 1825; p < 0.05) but without overloading healthcare professionals thanks to automatic alert management through artificial intelligence. Baseline factors independently associated with the likelihood of a severe alert were having asthma (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.22–2.48, p = 0.002) and taking corticosteroids (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.24–4.2, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The CDSS could be successfully implemented and enabled real-time telemonitoring of patients’ clinical status, providing valuable information to physicians and public health agencies.

N2  - Introduction: The advent of digital and mobile health innovations, especially use of wearables for passive data collection, allows remote monitoring and creates an abundance of data. For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. Research question: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? Methods: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. Results: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). Significance: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility.

N2  - Wearable sensors, among other informatics solutions, are readily accessible to enable noninvasive remote monitoring in healthcare. While providing a wealth of data, the wide variety of such sensing systems and the differing implementations of the same or similar sensors by different developers complicate comparisons of collected data. An online application as a platform technology that provides uniform methods for analysing balance data is presented as a case study. The development of balance problems is common in neurodegenerative conditions, leading to falls and a reduced quality of life. While balance can be assessed using, for example, perturbation tests, sensors offer a more quantitative and scalable way. Researchers can adjust the platform to integrate the sensors of their choice or upload data and then preprocess, featurise, analyse, and visualise them. This eases performing comparative analyses across the sensors and datasets through a reduction of heterogeneity and facilitates easy integration of machine learning and other advanced data analytics, thereby targeting personalising medical insights.

N2  - Pursuing high-performance conductive hydrogels is still hot topic in development of advanced flexible wearable devices. Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - The management of heart failure has undergone significant evolution, advancing from the initial utilization of digitalis and diuretics to the contemporary practice of personalized medicine and sophisticated device therapy. Despite these advancements, the persistent challenge of high hospitalization and readmission rates underscores an urgent need for innovative solutions. This manuscript explores how the integration of digital health technologies into interventional cardiology marks a paradigm shift in the management of heart failure. These technologies are no longer mere adjuncts but have become foundational to a modern approach, providing tools for continuous monitoring, patient education, and improved outcomes post-intervention. Through an examination of current trends, this perspective article highlights the transformative impact of wearable technologies, telehealth platforms, and advanced analytical tools in reshaping patient engagement and enabling proactive care strategies. Case studies illustrate the practical advantages, including enhanced medication adherence, early detection of heart failure signs, and a reduction in healthcare facility burdens. Central to this new digital health landscape is the Information Technology Management (ITM) system, a framework poised to revolutionize patient and caregiver engagement and pave the way for the future of interventional cardiology. This manuscript delineates the ITM system's innovative architecture and its consequential role in refining current and prospective cardiological interventions.

N2  - As Canada's population of older adults rises, the need for aging-in-place solutions is growing due to the declining quality of long-term-care homes and long wait times. While the current standards include questionnaire-based assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring.

N2  - The goal of this research is to create an ensemble deep learning model for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that specifically target remote patient monitoring (RPM) by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care. This study shows how using ensemble models' advantages might improve health monitoring's precision and promptness, which would eventually benefit patients and ease the burden on healthcare systems.

N2  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems provide real-time data and insights about patients' conditions without the need for constant physical visits to healthcare facilities. The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation. Thus the proposed model is reliable in improving the classification ratio and accuracy with fewer errors. The experimental values of the proposed model are as follows: IICM enhances classification by 6.65%, signal identification by 6.63%, and classification accuracy by 10.08%. This model reduces classification time by 9.51% and error by 10.14% for different ranges of inputs.

N2  - The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization.

N2  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a growing demand for telemedicine. Artificial intelligence and image processing systems with wireless transmission functionalities can facilitate remote care for otitis media (OM). Accordingly, this study developed and validated an algorithm-driven tele-otoscope system equipped with Wi-Fi transmission and a cloud-based automatic OM diagnostic algorithm. Study Design: Prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic study. Setting: Tertiary Academic Medical Center. Methods: We designed a tele-otoscope (Otiscan, SyncVision Technology Corp) equipped with digital imaging and processing modules, Wi-Fi transmission capabilities, and an automatic OM diagnostic algorithm. A total of 1137 otoscopic images, comprising 987 images of normal cases and 150 images of cases of acute OM and OM with effusion, were used as the dataset for image classification. Two convolutional neural network models, trained using our dataset, were used for raw image segmentation and OM classification. Results: The tele-otoscope delivered images with a resolution of 1280 × 720 pixels. Our tele-otoscope effectively differentiated OM from normal images, achieving a classification accuracy rate of up to 94% (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 96%). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the developed tele-otoscope has acceptable accuracy in diagnosing OM. This system can assist health care professionals in early detection and continuous remote monitoring, thus mitigating the consequences of OM.

N2  - Background: Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is often described as sudden cardiac death (affects >4 million people/year), where coronary artery disease is the only identified condition. Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. Objectives: To develop a single-lead ECG–based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: An FCHD single-lead (“lead I” from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. Results: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. Conclusion: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG.

N2  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers.

N2  - This research addresses the problem of detecting acute respiratory, urinary tract, and other infectious diseases in elderly nursing home residents using machine learning algorithms. The study analyzes data extracted from multiple vital signs and other contextual information for diagnostic purposes. The daily data collection process encounters sampling constraints due to weekends, holidays, shift changes, staff turnover, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in numerous nulls, repeated readings, outliers, and meaningless values. The short time series generated also pose a challenge to analysis, preventing the extraction of seasonal information or consistent trends. Blind data collection results in most of the data coming from periods when residents are healthy, resulting in excessively imbalanced data. This study proposes a data cleaning process and then builds a mechanism that reproduces the basal activity of the residents to improve the classification of the disease. The results show that the proposed basal module-assisted machine learning techniques allow anticipating diagnostics 2, 3 or 4 days before doctors decide to start treatment with antibiotics, achieving a performance measured by the area-under-the-curve metric of 0.857. The contributions of this work are: (1) a new data cleaning process; (2) the analysis of contextual information to improve data quality; (3) the generation of a baseline measure for relative comparison; and (4) the use of either binary (disease/no disease) or multiclass classification, differentiating among types of infections and showing the advantages of multiclass versus binary classification. From a medical point of view, the anticipated detection of infectious diseases in institutionalized individuals is brand new.

N2  - Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor's efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear's efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data.

N2  - Patients with advanced heart failure, due to the instability of their clinical conditions, need close surveillance to avoid dangerous exacerbations or sudden events. Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O2 saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well- structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector.

N2  - The present article underscored the indispensable significance of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring in anesthesia and critical care, offering critical insights into both ventilation and metabolism dynamics. The meticulous management of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspired oxygen levels during anesthesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Effective ventilation is imperative for proper gas exchange within the alveoli and maintaining a stable acid-base balance. In the context of circulatory physiology during anesthesia, cardiac output, blood pressure, and tissue perfusion hold paramount importance. The present article highlights how anesthesia-induced alterations in vascular tone and cardiac function could influence circulation and tissue oxygenation, impacting parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and ETCO2. Monitoring these parameters provides essential data for assessing circulatory status, guiding anesthesia management, and averting complications. ETCO2 monitoring has evolved into a standard practice in anesthesia and critical care settings, offering real-time, non-invasive insights. The present article delved into the extensive clinical applications, challenges, and future directions of ETCO2 monitoring. Encompassing fundamental principles, technological nuances, clinical implications, limitations, and avenues for research, this article advanced the understanding of this monitoring technique and its positive impact on patient care. The present article also discussed how ETCO2 levels reflect alveolar ventilation, providing critical data for assessing ventilation adequacy, readiness for extubation, and identification of impending respiratory distress. Furthermore, it delved into how ETCO2 levels serve as an indicator of cardiac output and tissue perfusion, guiding management strategies in various shock states and offering prognostic insights during CPR. Challenges and limitations associated with ETCO2 monitoring were clarified, with emphasis on technical considerations, patient populations with specific challenges, and potential interpretation pitfalls. The article outlines the exciting future directions of ETCO2 monitoring, encompassing wearable technology, remote monitoring capabilities, artificial intelligence integration, and potential applications beyond traditional realms.

N2  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are defining healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women-a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States-using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice.

N2  - The remote monitoring of vital signs and healthcare provision has become an urgent necessity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world. Blood oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches. It achieves an R2 value of 0.9769 in the statistical analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning.

N2  - Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies.

N2  - Wheezing is a critical indicator of various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously.

N2  - With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and quarantine have become commonplace across the world. IoT health monitoring solutions eliminate the need for regular doctor visits and interactions among patients and medical personnel. Many patients in wards or intensive care units require continuous monitoring of their health. Continuous patient monitoring is a hectic practice in hospitals with limited staff; in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, it becomes much more difficult practice when hospitals are working at full capacity and there is still a risk of medical workers being infected. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based patient health monitoring system that collects real-time data on important health indicators such as pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature but can be expanded to include more parameters. Our system is comprised of a hardware component that collects and transmits data from sensors to a cloud-based storage system, where it can be accessed and analyzed by healthcare specialists. The ESP-32 microcontroller interfaces with the multiple sensors and wirelessly transmits the collected data to the cloud storage system. A pulse oximeter is utilized in our system to measure blood oxygen saturation and body temperature, as well as a heart rate monitor to measure pulse rate. A web-based interface is also implemented, allowing healthcare practitioners to access and visualize the collected data in real-time, making remote patient monitoring easier. Overall, our IoT-based patient health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare practitioners to access real-time data on important health metrics and detect potential health issues before they escalate.

N2  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems.

N2  - Stoke is a leading cause of long-term disability, including upper-limb hemiparesis. Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with R2=0.72. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.

N2  - Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different from those familiar to today's providers.

N2  - Starting from the escalating global burden of mental health disorders, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize mental health care. With nearly one in five adults facing mental health issues and suicide ranking as a leading cause of death among the young, the strained mental health system seeks innovative solutions. The text discusses the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in image analysis for early physical health diagnoses, and its promising applications in mental health, including predictive analytics for various disorders. AI's ability to analyze written language, speech characteristics, and physiological signals from wearables offers avenues for remote monitoring and early prognosis. Despite the need to address ethical considerations, particularly biases in data sets and concerns about potential patient detachment, the article advocates for AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human involvement in mental health services. Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in enhancing diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies for mental health disorders.

T1  - PUFchain 3.0: Hardware-Assisted Distributed Ledger for Robust Authentication in Healthcare Cyber-Physical Systems
LA  - English
N2  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber-physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient's Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle's Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient's gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient's BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time.

N2  - Many stroke survivors experience persistent upper extremity impairment that limits performance in activities of daily living. Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors' task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.

N2  - Introduction: Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, is a therapeutic option for patients with Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations. However, the adoption of and adherence to this therapy have been limited by the need for complex delivery devices and specialized care as well as resource consumption, posing challenges for new physicians. Thailand is a unique example of a developing nation that has successfully implemented and continued the use of this therapy by employing cooperative technology that has dramatically enhanced apomorphine delivery services. Methods: Establishing apomorphine delivery services requires significant resources and step-by-step solutions. We began our services by implementing various strategies in three chronological stages: the initial stage (2013–2015), intermediate stage (2016–2019), and current stage (2020–present), each presenting unique challenges. Together, we also implemented a proposed set of five mottos to strengthen our apomorphine delivery service. Using additive technology, we developed a patient registry platform that combined electronic data acquisition, video and remote monitoring using wearable sensors, and in-house mobile applications to support our service. Results: At the initial stage, we assembled a team to enhance the efficacy and confirm the safety of apomorphine treatment in our hospital. At the intermediate stage, we expanded our apomorphine delivery services beyond just the patients at our hospital. We supported other hospitals in Thailand in setting up their own apomorphine services by educating both physicians and nurses regarding apomorphine therapy. With this educational undertaking, increased apomorphine-related knowledge among medical professionals, and a greater number of hospitals providing apomorphine services, an increasing number of patients were administered apomorphine in subsequent years. Currently, we are providing effective apomorphine delivery to improve patient outcomes and are seamlessly integrating technology into clinical practice. Incorporating integrative technologies in our apomorphine delivery program yielded positive results in data collection and support throughout patient care, in tracking patients’ statuses, in the long-term use of this treatment, and in increasing medication adherence rates. Conclusion: This perspective paper describes how technology can help provide supportive healthcare services in resource-constrained environments, such as in Thailand, offering a step-by-step approach to overcoming several limitations. The valuable insights from our 10-year journey in successfully integrating technology into apomorphine delivery services can benefit new physicians seeking to replicate our success.

N2  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.

N2  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.

N2  - Background: Heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback is often performed with structured education, laboratory-based assessments, and practice sessions. It has been shown to improve psychological and physiological function across populations. However, a means to remotely use and monitor this approach would allow for wider use of this technique. Advancements in wearable and digital technology present an opportunity for the widespread application of this approach. Objective: The primary aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of fully remote, self-administered short sessions of HRV-directed biofeedback in a diverse population of health care workers (HCWs). The secondary aim was to determine whether a fully remote, HRV-directed biofeedback intervention significantly alters longitudinal HRV over the intervention period, as monitored by wearable devices. The tertiary aim was to estimate the impact of this intervention on metrics of psychological well-being. Methods: To determine whether remotely implemented short sessions of HRV biofeedback can improve autonomic metrics and psychological well-being, we enrolled HCWs across 7 hospitals in New York City in the United States. They downloaded our study app, watched brief educational videos about HRV biofeedback, and used a well-studied HRV biofeedback program remotely through their smartphone. HRV biofeedback sessions were used for 5 minutes per day for 5 weeks. HCWs were then followed for 12 weeks after the intervention period. Psychological measures were obtained over the study period, and they wore an Apple Watch for at least 7 weeks to monitor the circadian features of HRV. Results: In total, 127 HCWs were enrolled in the study. Overall, only 21 (16.5%) were at least 50% compliant with the HRV biofeedback intervention, representing a small portion of the total sample. This demonstrates that this study design does not feasibly result in adequate rates of compliance with the intervention. Numerical improvement in psychological metrics was observed over the 17-week study period, although it did not reach statistical significance (all P>.05). Using a mixed effect cosinor model, the mean midline-estimating statistic of rhythm (MESOR) of the circadian pattern of the SD of the interbeat interval of normal sinus beats (SDNN), an HRV metric, was observed to increase over the first 4 weeks of the biofeedback intervention in HCWs who were at least 50% compliant. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that using brief remote HRV biofeedback sessions and monitoring its physiological effect using wearable devices, in the manner that the study was conducted, was not feasible. This is considering the low compliance rates with the study intervention. We found that remote short sessions of HRV biofeedback demonstrate potential promise in improving autonomic nervous function and warrant further study. Wearable devices can monitor the physiological effects of psychological interventions.

N2  - Rapid technological advancements, such as artificial intelligence, wearable technologies, and telehealth with remote monitoring, are transforming continuous education for health care providers (HCPs) in diabetes management. These technologies improve patient care and necessitate innovative educational approaches to prepare HCPs for clinical integration. Digital education offers real-time, scalable, and cost-effective solutions, especially in areas with health care workforce shortages. However, the effect of digital education on HCPs’ knowledge, skills, attitudes, and patient outcomes remains under-researched and necessitates further study. As technologies advance, achieving precision in diabetes continuous education becomes feasible. The 2024 ADA Standards of Care emphasize early adoption of advanced technologies and proficiency among HCPs. This commentary explores transformative trends, discussing limitations and proposing solutions to revolutionize continuous education in diabetes care.

N2  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2&#x0025;, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.

N2  - Motor symptoms such as tremor and bradykinesia can develop concurrently in Parkinson's disease; thus, the ideal home monitoring system should be capable of tracking symptoms continuously despite background noise from daily activities. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting symptom episodes in a free-living scenario, providing a higher level of interpretability to aid AI-powered decision-making. Machine learning models trained on wearable sensor data from scripted activities performed by participants in the lab and clinician ratings of the video recordings of these tasks identified tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in the supervised lab environment with a balanced accuracy of 83%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, when compared to the clinician ratings. The performance of the same models when evaluated on data from subjects performing unscripted activities unsupervised in their own homes achieved a balanced accuracy of 63%, 63%, and 67%, respectively, in comparison to self-assessment patient diaries, further highlighting their limitations. The ankle-worn sensor was found to be advantageous for the detection of dyskinesias but did not show an added benefit for tremor and bradykinesia detection here.

N2  - Background: The use of digital biomarkers through remote patient monitoring offers valuable and timely insights into a patient’s condition, including aspects such as disease progression and treatment response. This serves as a complementary resource to traditional health care settings leveraging mobile technology to improve scale and lower latency, cost, and burden. Objective: Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors have immense potential for improving health care through various apps and mobile health (mHealth) platforms. This capability could enable the development of reliable digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely from patients. Methods: We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support large-scale data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a modern remote data collection platform built around Confluent’s Apache Kafka to support scalability, extensibility, security, privacy, and quality of data. It provides support for study design and setup and active (eg, patient-reported outcome measures) and passive (eg, phone sensors, wearable devices, and Internet of Things) remote data collection capabilities with feature generation (eg, behavioral, environmental, and physiological markers). The back end enables secure data transmission and scalable solutions for data storage, management, and data access. Results: The platform has been used to successfully collect longitudinal data for various cohorts in a number of disease areas including multiple sclerosis, depression, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, autism, and lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases. Conclusions: RADAR-base offers a contemporary, open-source solution driven by the community for remotely monitoring, collecting data, and digitally characterizing both physical and mental health conditions. Clinicians have the ability to enhance their insight through the use of digital biomarkers, enabling improved prevention, personalization, and early intervention in the context of disease management.

N2  - Background: The proportion of very old adults in the population is increasing, representing a significant challenge. Due to their vulnerability, there is a higher frequency of unplanned hospitalizations in this population, leading to adverse events. Digital tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) can help to identify early signs of vulnerability and unfavorable health events and can contribute to earlier and optimized management. Objective: This study aims to report the implementation in assisted living facilities of an innovative monitoring system (Presage Care) for predicting the short-term risk of emergency hospitalization. We describe its use and assess its performance. Methods: An uncontrolled multicenter intervention study was conducted between March and August 2022 in 7 assisted living facilities in France that house very old and vulnerable adults. The monitoring system was set up to provide alerts in cases of a high risk of emergency hospitalization. Nurse assistants (NAs) at the assisted living facilities used a smartphone app to complete a questionnaire on the functional status of the patients, comprising electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs); these were analyzed in real time by a previously designed machine learning algorithm. This remote monitoring of patients using ePROMs allowed notification of a coordinating nurse or a coordinating NA who subsequently informed the patient’s nurses or physician. The primary outcomes were the acceptability and feasibility of the monitoring system in the context and confirmation of the effectiveness and efficiency of AI in risk prevention and detection in practical, real-life scenarios. The secondary outcome was the hospitalization rate after alert-triggered interventions.Results: In this study, 118 of 194 (61%) eligible patients were included who had at least 1 follow-up visit. A total of 38 emergency hospitalizations were documented. The system generated 92 alerts for 47 of the 118 (40%) patients. Of these 92 alerts, 46 (50%) led to 46 health care interventions for 14 of the 118 (12%) patients and resulted in 4 hospitalizations. The other 46 of the 92 (50%) alerts did not trigger a health care intervention and resulted in 25 hospitalizations (P<.001). Almost all hospitalizations were associated with a lack of alert-triggered interventions (P<.001). System performance to predict hospitalization had a high specificity (96%) and negative predictive value (99.4%).Conclusions: The Presage Care system has been implemented with success in assisted living facilities. It was well accepted by coordinating nurses and performed well in predicting emergency hospitalizations. However, its use by NAs was less than expected. Overall, the system performed well in terms of performance and clinical impact in this setting. Nevertheless, further work is needed to improve the moderate use rate by NAs.

N2  - Shoulder rehabilitation is a process that requires physical therapy sessions to recover the mobility of the affected limbs. However, these sessions are often limited by the availability and cost of specialized technicians, as well as the patient's travel to the session locations. This paper presents a novel smartphone-based approach using a pose estimation algorithm to evaluate the quality of the movements and provide feedback, allowing patients to perform autonomous recovery sessions. This paper reviews the state of the art in wearable devices and camera-based systems for human body detection and rehabilitation support and describes the system developed, which uses MediaPipe to extract the coordinates of 33 key points on the patient's body and compares them with reference videos made by professional physiotherapists using cosine similarity and dynamic time warping. This paper also presents a clinical study that uses QTM, an optoelectronic system for motion capture, to validate the methods used by the smartphone application. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the three methods for different exercises, highlighting the importance of selecting an appropriate method for specific exercises. This paper discusses the implications and limitations of the findings and suggests directions for future research.

N2  - Objective.Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for remotely monitoring patients' vital signals, but is often affected by measurement noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics.Approach.In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability.Main results.Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates.Significance.Our approach enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials.

N2  - The remarkable increase in the number of patients poses challenges to healthcare providers in telemedicine systems, and certain challenges are associated with the difficulties of identifying the most urgent emergencies to save lives. Remote monitoring of patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) is a major issue that must be addressed. This work aims to improve the triage system for remote patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system by considering the variation in their chronic diseases (chronic heart, hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes diseases). The proposed framework named machine learning-based remote triage framework in telemedicine (ML-ART) collects the patient’s data using medical sensors and sources within Internet of medical things (IoMT) environment, transfers the data through gateway to telemedicine servers in the hospital, where machine learning is performed to classify (triages) each patient into one of five categories (normal, cold, sick, urgent, and risk) depending on the medical emergency level of the patients. The simulation results showed that the decision tree (DT) algorithm has the most accurate result, 100%, compared to the relevant algorithm (neural network (NN) 97%, support vector machine (SVM) 91%, and random forest (RF) 97%). The performance of (DT) logically matched the medical triage procedure. Moreover, the (ML-ART) outcomes improve the performance of e-triage system for remote patients and pave the way for future works in telemedicine systems through moving from remote monitoring to remote diagnostics.

N2  - Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4 h and CBT > 38.0 °C occurred in 66% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r = 0.72). Bland–Altman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11 °C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were − 0.67 to + 0.93 °C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user.

N2  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management.

N2  - Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases.

N2  - Microalgal biotechnology holds the potential for renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and carbon capture applications due to unparalleled photosynthetic efficiency and diversity. Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP3 UFS), the largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an average value based traditional machine learning method (R2 = 0.77 ≫ R2 = 0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational forecasting.

N2  - Healthcare highly depends on accessing, processing, analyzing, sharing, and storing electronic data. Cloud computing has evolved in various healthcare fields, such as bioinformatics, health management systems, and telemedicine. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a subset of IoT, is an essential element of a healthcare management system. The expeditious development in IoMT, intelligent medical devices, healthcare applications, and high-speed networks has enabled medical systems to efficiently diagnose, treat, manage diseases, and remotely monitor and improve the Quality of Service (QoS). To achieve this high data, high speed network, longer battery life and reliable connectivity are basic requirements. 5G conformed these needs with its numerous and distinct potential. However, the shortcomings of these medical devices in the IoMT are privacy concerns and direct physical threats. We propose a new algorithm to enhance the QoS of the IoMT devices/systems. Initially, the dataset is collected and the 5G network is operationalized. We propose a Dynamic Step-wise Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm to encrypt data. Encrypted data is transmitted using the Energy Efficient Routing Protocol. When the user requests to access the data, the data is decrypted. We show that the proposed system has higher QoS attributes and is more effective. Our experimental results show that our proposed solution considerably improves QoS and network performance in terms of lifetime, communication overhead, storage footprint, and power consumption compared to the competing methods.

N2  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a fundamental framework for interconnected device communication, representing a relatively new paradigm and the evolution of the Internet into its next phase. Its significance is pronounced in diverse fields, especially healthcare, where it finds applications in scenarios such as medical service tracking. By analyzing patterns in observed parameters, the anticipation of disease types becomes feasible. Stress monitoring with wearable sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a potential application that can enhance wellness and preventative health management. Healthcare professionals have harnessed robust systems incorporating battery-based wearable technology and wireless communication channels to enable cost-effective healthcare monitoring for various medical conditions. Network-connected sensors, whether within living spaces or worn on the body, accumulate data crucial for evaluating patients' health. The integration of machine learning and cutting-edge technology has sparked research interest in addressing stress levels. Psychological stress significantly impacts a person's physiological parameters. Stress can have negative impacts over time, prompting sometimes costly therapies. Acute stress levels can even constitute a life-threatening risk, especially in people who have previously been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia. To offer a proactive solution within the realm of smart healthcare, this article introduces a novel machine learning-based system termed "Stress-Track". The device is intended to track a person's stress levels by examining their body temperature, sweat, and motion rate during physical activity. The proposed model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.5%, showcasing its potential impact on stress management and healthcare enhancement.

N2  - Telemedicine can provide benefits in patient affected by chronic diseases or elderly citizens as part of standard routine care supported by digital health. The GATEKEEPER (GK) Project was financed to create a vendor independent platform to be adopted in medical practice and to demonstrate its effect, benefit value, and scalability in 8 connected medical use cases with some independent pilots. This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

N2  - Introduction: Distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at early disease stages is important for clinical trial enrollment and clinical care/prognostication. Methods: We recruited 21 participants with PSP(n = 11) or PD(n = 10) with reliable caregivers. Standardized passage reading, counting, and sustained phonation were recorded on the BioDigit Home tablet (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA), and speech features from the assessments were analyzed using the BioDigit Speech platform (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA). An independent t-test was performed to compare each speech feature between PSP and PD participants. We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants. PSP participants also had longer pause times (17.24(5.47) vs 8.45(3.13) sec) and longer total signal times (52.44(6.67) vs (36.67(6.73) sec) when reading the passage. In terms of the phonation ‘a’, PSP participants showed a significant higher spectral entropy, spectral centroid, and spectral spread compared to PD participants and no differences were found for phonation ‘e’. PD participants had more accurate reverse number counts than PSP participants (14.89(3.86) vs 7.36(4.67)). PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) dysarthria (r = 0.79, p = 0.004) and bulbar item scores (r = 0.803, p = 0.005) were positively correlated with articulation rate in reverse number counts. Correct reverse number counts were positively correlated with total Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = 0.703, p = 0.016). Machine learning models using passage reading-derived measures obtained an AUC of 0.93, and the sensitivity/specificity in correctly classifying PSP and PD participants were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of differentiating PSP from PD using a digital health technology platform. Further multi-center studies are needed to expand and validate our initial findings.

N2  - Smart home monitoring systems via internet of things (IoT) are required for taking care of elders at home. They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system's results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved.

N2  - Wearable devices and mobile sensors enable the real-time collection of an abundant source of physiological and behavioural data unobtrusively. Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores.

N2  - Continuous monitoring of stress in individuals during their daily activities has become an inevitable need in present times. Unattended stress is a silent killer and may lead to fatal physical and mental disorders if left unidentified. Stress identification based on individual judgement often leads to under-diagnosis and delayed treatment possibilities. EEG-based stress monitoring is quite popular in this context, but impractical to use for continuous remote monitoring.Continuous remote monitoring of stress using signals acquired from everyday wearables like smart watches is the best alternative here. Non-EEG data such as heart rate and ectodermal activity can also act as indicators of physiological stress. In this work, we have explored the possibility of using nonlinear features from non-EEG data such as (a) heart rate, (b) ectodermal activity, (c) body temperature (d) SpO2 and (e) acceleration in detecting four different types of neurological states; namely (1) Relaxed state, (2) State of Physical stress, (3) State of Cognitive stress and (4) State of Emotional stress. Physiological data of 20 healthy adults have been used from the noneeg database of PhysioNet.Results: We used two machine learning models; a linear logistic regression and a nonlinear random forest to detect (a) stress from relaxed state and (4) the four different neurological states. We trained the models using linear and nonlinear features separately. For the 2-class and 4-class problems, using nonlinear features increased the accuracy of the models. Moreover, it is also proved in this study that by using nonlinear features, we can avoid the use of complex machine learning models.

N2  - Coronary artery disease (CAD), an acute and life-threatening cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Coronary angiography, the principal diagnostic tool for CAD, is invasive, expensive, and requires a lot of skilled effort. The current study aims to develop an automated and non-invasive CAD detection model and improve its performance as closely as possible to clinically acceptable diagnostic sensitivity. Electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics are observed to be altered due to CAD and can be studied to develop a screening tool for its detection. The subject's clinical information can help broadly identify the high-cardiac-risk population and serve as a primary step in diagnosing CAD. This paper presents an approach to automatically detect CAD based on clinical data, morphological ECG features, and heart rate variability (HRV) features extracted from short-duration Lead-II ECG recordings. A few popular machine-learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), are trained on the extracted feature space, and their performance is evaluated. Classifiers built by integrating clinical data and features extracted from ECG recordings demonstrated better performance than those built on each feature set separately, and the RF classifier outperforms other considered machine learners and reports an average testing accuracy of 94% and a G-mean score of 92% with a 5-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 95(± 0.04)%.Clinical relevance- The proposed method uses a brief, single-lead ECG recording and performs similarly to current clinical practices in an explainable manner. This makes it suitable for deployment via wearable technology (like smart watch gadgets) and telemonitoring, which may facilitate an earlier and more widespread CAD diagnosis.

N2  - Ischemic heart disease (IHD), a critical and dreadful cardiovascular disease, is a leading cause of death globally. The steady progress of IHD leads to an irreversible condition called myocardial infarction (MI). The detection of MI can be done by observing the altered electrocardiogram (ECG) characteristics. Often, automated ECG analysis is preferred in place of visual inspection to reduce time and ensure reliable detection even when the recording quality is not very good. This paper presents an automated approach to classify recent MI, past MI, and normal sinus rhythm (NSR) classes based on the morphological features of the ECG. In clinical practice, a standard 12-lead ECG setup is typically employed to identify MI. However, acquiring a 12-lead ECG is not always convenient. Hence, in this study, we have explored the possibility of using a minimal number of ECG leads by deriving the augmented limb leads using leads I and II. A well-known and widely used ensemble machine learning tool, the random forest (RF) classifier is trained using features extracted from the derived augmented limb leads and their combinations. An RF classifier built using features extracted from all limb leads has outperformed classifiers built on combinations of them with five-fold cross-validation training accuracy of 97.9 (±0.008) % and testing accuracy of 98 %.Clinical relevance- As high sensitivity is reported in identifying recent MI and past MI classes, the proposed approach is suitable for preventative healthcare applications since it is less likely that subjects with recent or past MI will be misclassified. Due to its low computational complexity, better interpretability, and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art results, the proposed approach can be employed in clinical and cardiac health screening applications. It also has the potential to be employed in remote monitoring with mobile and wearable devices because it is built on features extracted from only lead I and II ECG recordings.

N2  - Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission.

N2  - Aggression in children is highly prevalent and can have devastating consequences, yet there is currently no objective method to track its frequency in daily life. This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children.

N2  - In this work, we propose SemBox - Semantic interoperability in a Box, to enable wireless on-the-go communication between heterogeneous wearable health monitoring devices. It can connect wirelessly to the health monitoring devices and receive their data packets. It uses a Mamdani-based fuzzy inference system with data pre-processing to classify the received data packet into one of the classes of the vital parameters. It enables semantic interoperability by labelling and annotating the data packets based on the extracted packet information. We implement SemBox using three different health monitoring wearables, with different keywords used for each vital parameter representation in the data packet. SemBox shows a maximum classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a maximum PDR of 1 at the SemBox with varying device parameters. Overall, SemBox is a potential plug-and-play solution to achieve semantic interoperability and collaboration between heterogeneous health monitoring wearable devices, irrespective of their commercial and proprietary specifications. It is customizable for applications that use multiple heterogeneous devices for collaborative monitoring and decision support. SemBox enables interoperability among health monitoring devices, introduces flexibility and ease the inter-device dynamics in the domain of biomedical research.

N2  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for recording human vital signs. PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%). The proposed method enhances accuracy in monitoring physiological signals and thus is suitable for healthcare applications.

N2  - To develop intelligent wearable protection systems is of great significance to human health engineering. An ideal intelligent air filtration system should possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH2O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS not only has practical significance for human health management but also has great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems.

N2  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices.

N2  - Wearable electrochemical sensors have attracted tremendous attention and have been experiencing rapid growth in recent years. Sweat, one of the most suitable biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and the substrate. In addition, graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of NH4+ from 10−6 M to 10−1 M with high stability and sensitivity—showing a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH4+] and an LOD lower than 10−6 M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 mV/log [NH4+]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring.

U1  - The rapid development of flexible electronic technology has led to the in-depth study of flexible wearable sensors to achieve accurate sensing under different external stimuli. However, it is still a huge challenge to develop hydrogel-based wearable skin-like sensors with super ductility, high sensitivity, and self-healing properties. Herein, the Ti3C2 type of MXene was synthesized, and the Ag/MXene nanocomplexes were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol-borax matrix to construct a novel composite hydrogel as the multifunctional nanofillers, which could bring both improved properties and novel functionalities. The Ag/MXene-Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth’s movement and throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases represent the leading cause of death worldwide. Thus, cardiovascular rehabilitation programs are crucial to mitigate the deaths caused by this condition each year, mainly in patients with coronary artery disease. COVID-19 was not only a challenge in this area but also an opportunity to open remote or hybrid versions of these programs, potentially reducing the number of patients who leave rehabilitation programs due to geographical/time barriers. This paper presents a method for building a cardiovascular rehabilitation prediction model using retrospective and prospective data with different features using stacked machine learning, transfer feature learning, and the joint distribution adaptation tool to address this problem. We illustrate the method over a Chilean rehabilitation center, where the prediction performance results obtained for 10-fold cross-validation achieved error levels with an NMSE of (Formula presented.) and an (Formula presented.) of (Formula presented.), where the best-achieved performance was an error level with a normalized mean squared error of 0.008 and an (Formula presented.) up to (Formula presented.). The results are encouraging for remote cardiovascular rehabilitation programs because these models could support the prioritization of remote patients needing more help to succeed in the current rehabilitation phase.

N2  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF.

N2  - The use of telemonitoring solutions via wearable sensors is believed to play a major role in the prevention and therapy of physical weakening in older adults. Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems.

N2  - Digital health and telemonitoring have resulted in a wealth of information to be collected to monitor, manage, and improve human health. The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients’ health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy.

N2  - The present-day healthcare system operates on a 4G network, where the data rate needed for many IoT devices is impossible. Also, the latency involved in the network does not support the use of many devices in the network. The 5G-based cellular technology promises an effective healthcare management system with high speed and low latency. The 5G communication technology will replace the 4G technology to satisfy the increasing demand for high data rates. It incorporates higher frequency bands of around 100 MHz using millimetre waves and broadband modulation schemes. It is aimed at providing low latency while supporting real-time machine-to-machine communication. It requires a more significant number of antennas, with an average base station density three times higher than 4G. However, the rise in circuit and processing power for multiple antennas and transceivers deteriorates energy efficiency. Also, the data transmission power for 5G is three times higher than for 4G technology. One of the advanced processors used in today's mobile equipment is NVIDIA Tegra, which has a multicore system on chip (SoC) architecture with two ARM Cortex CPU cores to handle audio, images, and video. The state-of-the-art software coding using JAVA or Python has achieved smooth data transmission from mobile equipment, desktop or laptop through the internet with the support of 5G communication technology. This paper discusses some key areas related to 5G-based healthcare systems such as the architecture, antenna designs, power consumption, file protocols, security, and health implications of 5G networks.

N2  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences.

N2  - Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms.

N2  - Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

N2  - This research work delves into the dynamics of investor decision-making and the efficacy of forecasting models used to comprehend market movements. The study aims to determine suitable models that can elucidate agent behavior, enabling easier decision-making through accurate anticipation of future asset prices. Artificial intelligence models, specifically Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms, are employed to gain deeper insights into asset price variations and their future evolution. A comparative analysis between classical models and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms reveals the limitations of classical statistical models, as they rely on assumptions that often do not hold in the context of financial series. Consequently, their predictive capacity for new data is compromised. In contrast, the integration of AI, particularly RNN, allows us to overcome the assumption of market efficiency and successfully model the behavior of irrational agents who engage in trading based on rumors and false news. By harnessing the power of AI, this study lays the groundwork for a more accurate and robust understanding of investor behavior and market movements. The findings present significant implications for the financial sector, offering an enhanced approach to decision-making and risk management. The intelligent monitoring system developed through this research holds great potential for fostering smarter, data-driven decisions and anticipating market trends, ultimately leading to improved performance and profitability.

N2  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness.

N2  - To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods.

N2  - In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection.

N2  - Academics and the health community are paying much attention to developing smart remote patient monitoring, sensors, and healthcare technology. For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time.

N2  - Background: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted.

N2  - A continuous heart disease monitoring system is one of the significant applications specified by the Internet of Things (IoT). This goal might be achieved by combining sophisticated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experiment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contributions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart disease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring system. The simulation outcomes proved that the recommended approach is more successful at predicting heart illness than existing technologies.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD.

N2  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.

N2  - Purpose: Parkinson’s Disease comes on top among neurodegenerative diseases affecting 10 million worldwide. To detect Parkinson’s Disease in a prior state, gait analysis is an effective choice. However, monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease using gait analysis is time consuming and exhaustive for patients and physicians. To assess severity of symptoms, a rating scale called Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is used. It determines mild and severe cases. Today, Parkinson’s Disease severity assessment is made in gait laboratories and by manual examination. These are time consuming and it is costly for health institutions to build and maintain laboratories. By using low-cost wearables and an effective model, aforementioned problems can be solved. Methods: We provide a computerized solution for quantifiable assessment of Parkinson’s Disease symptoms severity. By using wearable sensors, our framework can predict exact symptom values to assess Parkinson’s Disease severity. We propose a deep learning approach that utilizes Ground Reaction Force sensors. From sensor signals, features are extracted and fed to a hybrid deep learning model. This model is the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Locally Weighted Random Forest. Results: Proposed framework achieved 0.897, 3.009, 4.556 in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, respectively. Proposed framework outperformed other machine and deep learning models. We also evaluated classification performance for disease detection. We outperformed most of the previous studies, achieving 99.5% accuracy, 98.7% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. Conclusion: This is the first study to use a deep learning regression approach to predict exact symptom value of Parkinson’s Disease patients. Results show that this approach can be effectively employed as a disease severity assessment tool using wearable sensors.

N2  - Development of predictive computational models of metabolism through mechanistic models is complex and resource demanding, and their personalization remains challenging. Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle.

N2  - Urinalysis is attractive in non-invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular-specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field-effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder-tumor-associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine-learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non-bladder cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non-invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine.

N2  - Stair climb power (SCP) is a clinical measure of leg muscular function assessed in-clinic via the Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT). This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with &gt;89% accuracy [sensitivity = &gt;0.89, specificity = &gt;0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0-6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3-6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of SCP.

N2  - Skin-inspired flexible wearable acceleration sensors attract much attention due to their advantages of portability, personalized and comfortable experience, and potential application in healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, and physical sports performance evaluation. This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island–bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation.

N2  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that includes gait analysis may be useful for various rehabilitation and telemonitoring applications. Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information.

N2  - The hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions. Our work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sensor for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

N2  - Undiagnosed malnutrition is a significant problem in high-income countries, which can reduce the quality of life of many individuals, particularly of older adults. Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations.

N2  - A soft bending sensor based on the inverse pyramid structure is demonstrated, revealing that it can effectively suppress microcrack formation in designated regions, thus allowing the cracks to open gradually with bending in a controlled manner. Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2 ∼ 0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics.

N2  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2-90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI.

N2  - Current developments in sensors and actuators are heralding a new era to facilitate things to happen effortlessly and efficiently with proper communication. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) has been boomed up with er potential and occupies a wide range of disciplines. This study has choreographed to design of an algorithm and a smart data-processing scheme to implement the obtained data from the sensing system to transmit to the receivers. Technically, it is called “telediagnosis” and “remote digital monitoring,” a revolution in the field of medicine and artificial intelligence. For the proof of concept, an algorithmic approach has been implemented for telediagnosis with one of the degenerative diseases, that is, Parkinson's disease. Using the data acquired from an improved interdigitated electrode, sensing surface was evaluated with the attained sensitivity of 100 fM (n = 3), and the limit of detection was calculated with the linear regression value coefficient. By the designed algorithm and data processing with the assistance of IoT, further validation was performed and attested the coordination. This proven concept can be ideally used with all sensing strategies for immediate telemedicine by end-to-end communications.

N2  - Flexible and wearable pressure sensors have gained great popularity in consumer electronics due to their potential applications in human healthcare, E-skin, and artificial intelligence interactions. MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics.

N2  - COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and F-measure.

N2  - Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

N2  - Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.

N2  - Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model.

N2  - Sweat-activated batteries (SABs) are lightweight, biocompatible energy generators that produce sufficient power for skin-interface electronic devices. However, the fabrication of 1D SABs that are compatible with conventional textile techniques for self-powered wearable electronics remains challenging. In this study, a cotton-yarn-based SAB (CYSAB) with a segmental structure is developed, in which carbon-black-modified, pristine yarn and Zn foil-wrapped segments are prepared to serve as the cathode, salt bridge, and anode, respectively. Upon electrolyte absorption, the CYSAB can be rapidly activated. Its performance is closely related to the ion concentration, infiltrated electrolyte volume, and evaporation rate. The CYSAB can tolerate repeated bending and washing without any significant influence on its power output. Moreover, the CYSABs can be woven into fabrics and connected in series and parallel configurations to produce an energy supplying headband, which can be activated by the sweat secreted from a volunteer during a cycling exercise to power light-emitting diode headlights. The developed CYSAB can also be integrated with yarn-based strain sensors to achieve a smart textile for the self-powered sensing of human motion and breathing. This weavable, washable, and scalable CYSAB is expected to contribute to the manufacturing of self-powered smart textiles for future applications in wearable healthcare monitoring.

N2  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven adaptive techniques are viable to optimize the resources in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable healthcare devices. Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.

In particular, health products and services have expanded by the use and development of artificial intelligence, mobile health applications, and wearable electronic devices. Such advancements have enabled accurate and updated tracking and modeling of health conditions. For instance, digital health technologies are capable of measuring environmental pollution and predicting its adverse health effects. Several health conditions, including chronic airway diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, can be exacerbated by pollution. These diseases impose substantial health burdens with high morbidity and mortality. Recently, efforts have been made to develop digital technologies to alleviate such conditions. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has facilitated the application of telemedicine and telemonitoring for patients with chronic airway diseases. This article reviews current trends and studies in digital technology utilization for investigating and managing environmental exposure and chronic airway diseases. First, we discussed the recent progression of digital technologies in general environmental healthcare. Then, we summarized the capacity of digital technologies in predicting exacerbation and self-management of airway diseases. Concluding these reviews, we provided suggestions to improve digital health technologies’ abilities to reduce the adverse effects of environmental exposure in chronic airway diseases, based on personal exposure-response modeling.

N2  - Human health issues must be closely examined and addressed with proper medications. Chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease (HD), cancer, and chronic respiratory disease are the main causes of death worldwide. The previous 10 years have seen a lot of research into healthcare services and their technology advancements. To be more specific, the Internet of Things (IoT) has showed promise in connecting a variety of medical devices, sensors, and healthcare specialists in order to provide high-quality medical treatment in a remote place. Patient safety has improved, healthcare expenses have decreased, healthcare services have become more accessible, and the healthcare industry's operational efficiency has increased. In this paper, a diabetic patient monitoring strategy is proposed that uses an IoT-based machine learning technique called eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to support in diabetes diagnosis and classification. A successful implementation of any classifier requires proper hyperparameter optimization. This work employed Bayesian optimization, which is a very effective method for hyper-parameter optimization, to optimize the hyper-parameters of XGBoost. The efficacy of the suggested method is assessed in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1score. It outperforms better than the other existing algorithms.

N2  - COVID-19 (Corona Virus) is a very transmissible infection that has the world’s attention lastly. This virus can be transmitted from any patient to other people by direct contact,it could be spread if the person sneezes or coughs. It is also spread by touching a surface that contains a virus.In this paper, the intelligent healthcare system is proposed, that integrates cloud computing technologies. Its architecture utilizes smart sensors, microcontrollers, C ++ and the Php programming languages to program the Arduino and cluad. The temperature sensor, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees, and the sound sensor are used in this paper. These sensors will send the data of the patient to the SQL database and cloud after encryption it by RSA algorithm. Finally the data transport to the monitor and the doctor or nurse can monitor the patients from web browser from any device such as smart phones, ipads, or PC computers from any place remotely without touching the patients. This architecture can reduce the transmission of infections by touch, in addition to monitoring all cases in a hospital without potential. The system tracks the state of patients and delivers timely, reliable, and high quality healthcare with minimum cost. The presented architecture will be useful in diagnosis research and healthcare systems.The computing cloud is necessary for highly challenging architectures like intelligent healthcare. The concept of intelligent architecture healthcare systems was to provide patient surveillance at all times, in addition to real time connectivity. In addition, the sensors are required for this architecture to be applied to any patient afflicted with any disease. Therefore, by adding the sensors are required.

N2  - In this paper, we discuss our journey as academic entrepreneurs, which began when we saw a market for objective markers for the diagnosis and assessment of mental health disorders. For most of history, mental health disorders have been chiefly defined by the subjective experiences of people with these disorders - we know people have a depressive disorder because they feel depressed or that they have a psychotic disorder because they experience hallucinations. The lack of objective markers to track changes in mental health symptoms creates barriers to treatment. To address this, the vision of KeyWise AI is the further development and commercialization of an innovative digital phenotyping technology that turns smartphones into fitness trackers for the brain. We first describe how we commercialized findings derived from the ongoing citizen science BiAffect study and how our brain fitness-tracking technology supports real-time passive and unobtrusive modeling and monitoring of emotional, behavioral and cognitive processes. The core technology centers around a custom-built smartphone keyboard that replaces the default keyboard, thus allowing for unobtrusive collection of anonymized keyboard dynamics and motor kinetics metadata. We conclude this paper with some general guidelines that may help future academic entrepreneurs on their startup journey.

N2  - Over the past two periods, advancements in communication technology have exploded, with the last decade seeing an unprecedented explosion in the production of numerous cutting-edge, handheld and small communication devices. Modern, high-speed wireless communication technologies that employ complex network and communication protocols and standards have quickly supplanted the traditional wired scheme of communication. Wireless medical sensor networks are a promising application of WSNs in healthcare since they allow for remote patient monitoring (WMSNs). Reliable patient communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing are at the forefront of current WMSN healthcare research developments. Nonetheless, patients' personal information is at risk when new technologies are implemented in healthcare applications without proper security measures being taken. In this study, we present a privacy-preserving strategy for the secure transfer of medical records over WSNs by combining secret sharing, and hashing. The healthcare information gathered by a wireless sensor network is broken down into subsets. In addition, a popular hashing algorithm is used to determine a unique identifier for each constituent. Any alterations to the message will result in a different hash value. Multipath routing is then used to send these parts to the servers. In order to verify the efficacy of the new method, this paper presents comprehensive simulations. The results indicate that secret splitting, in conjunction with multipath routing, aids in the maintenance of confidentiality in a wireless sensor network-based healthcare scheme.

N2  - Without the Internet of Things, patients could interact with doctors through various forms of communication, such as visits, text messaging, and telephone. However, no technology allowed doctors to monitor patient's health remotely. With the Internet of Things (IoT) development, remote patient health monitoring has become possible. This has allowed doctors to provide the best possible care and improve the quality of life for their patients.It has also made it easier for them to interact with their patients.Remote monitoring of a patient's health has been shown to reduce the length of their stay in the hospital and prevent them from re-admissions. It has also brought about various improvements in their treatment.The field of electronic healthcare systems (EHS) is considered to be the most promising area of digital innovation. It involves the collection and use of data related to health conditions. Many of the sensors and devices used in this field are connected to the internet.In this paper, a remote monitoring system is proposed that allows patients to monitor their health through the Internet of Things with cloud convergence.

N2  - The rapid development of communication technologies and expert systems have resulted in a large volume of medical data. Big data such as clinical data, omics data, and electronic health data are difficult to manage in real-time due to noise, large size, different formats, missing values and large features. Hence, it is more difficult for the health monitoring system to extract the correct information. Low quality and noisy data can lead to unnecessary treatment. To overcome these issues, we proposed Enriched Salp Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ESSOBiLSTM) to monitor health. This method consists of four layers, such as the data collection layer, data storage layer, data analytics, and presentation layer. The initial layer handles a variety of information from main sources: wearable sensor devices (WSD), social network data, and medical records (MR). The second layer stores all the collected data from WSD, MR, and social network data to the cloud server through the wireless network. The proposed framework for performing big data analytics steps like preprocessing, filtering, dimensionality reduction, and classification is performed in the third layer. In the final layer, the doctor analyzes the patient's condition based on the classification results of the enriched SSO-BiLSTM. Based on the evaluation report, the proposed ESSOBiLSTM gives an accuracy of 85%, precision of 80%, RMSE of 0.6, MAE of 0.58, recall of 85% and F-measure of 79%. As a result, ESSOBiLSTM has proven to be more effective in monitoring health in large datasets.

N2  - Objective. Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where devices learn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventional to patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a disease by observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attending to the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-time data, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and all these to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the work was to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models for symptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. Methods. Comparative analysis of predictive microbiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learning classifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, random forest, decision trees, Naïve Bayes, and gradient booster is reported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models, performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measured for accuracy. Results. From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN was more accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boosting classifier (87.77), and Naïve Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. Conclusion. The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinical significance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reported here and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide to counter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics the humanity may suffer from time to come.

N2  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article.

N2  - Healthcare occupies a central role in sustainable societies and has an undeniable impact on the well-being of individuals. However, over the years, various diseases have adversely affected the growth and sustainability of these societies. Among them, heart disease is escalating rapidly in both economically settled and undeveloped nations and leads to fatalities around the globe. To reduce the death ratio caused by this disease, there is a need for a framework to continuously monitor a patient's heart status, essentially doing early detection and prediction of heart disease. This paper proposes a scalable Machine Learning (ML) and Internet of Things-(IoT-) based three-layer architecture to store and process a large amount of clinical data continuously, which is needed for the early detection and monitoring of heart disease. Layer 1 of the proposed framework is used to collect data from IoT wearable/implanted smart sensor nodes, which includes various physiological measures that have significant impact on the deterioration of heart status. Layer 2 stores and processes the patient data on a local web server using various ML classification algorithms. Finally, Layer 3 is used to store the critical data of patients on the cloud. The doctor and other caregivers can access the patient health conditions via an android application, provide services to the patient, and inhibit him/her from further damage. Various performance evaluation measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-measure, MCC-score, and ROC curve are used to check the efficiency of our proposed IoT-based heart disease prediction framework. It is anticipated that this system will assist the healthcare sector and the doctors in diagnosing heart patients in the initial phases.

N2  - Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m-1 , and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 °C-1 ) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications.

N2  - In the past few years, remote monitoring technologies have grown increasingly important in the delivery of healthcare. According to healthcare professionals, a variety of factors influence the public perception of connected healthcare systems in a variety of ways. First and foremost, wearable technology in healthcare must establish better bonds with the individuals who will be using them. The emotional reactions of patients to obtaining remote healthcare services may be of interest to healthcare practitioners if they are given the opportunity to investigate them. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based classification system that aims to detect the emotions from the input data using metaheuristic feature selection and machine learning classification. The proposed model is made to undergo series of steps involving preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model on various features present in a dataset. The results of simulation show that the proposed model is effective enough to classify the emotions from the input dataset than other existing methods.

N2  - A smart city is an intelligent space, in which large amounts of data are collected and analyzed using low-cost sensors and automatic algorithms. The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve the development of sustainable and smart cities.

N2  - In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.

KW  - pilot study
N2  - The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events-bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)-from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56-64.66 and 40.19-72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06-48.42, 40.19-72.70 and 36.06-60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials.

N2  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system.

N2  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes.

N2  - Background: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence–based methods can be used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Methods: This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study consists of 2 phases: (1) a development study and (2) a feasibility study. We plan to enroll 400 participants with an ICD (with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy) on remote monitoring: 300 participants in the development study and 100 in the feasibility study. During 12-month follow-up, electronic health record data, remote monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed physical behavior data, and patient-reported data are collected. By using machine- and deep-learning approaches, a prediction engine is developed to assess the risk probability of ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). The feasibility of the prediction engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart Platform, is assessed during the feasibility study. Results: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The feasibility study starts in 2022. Conclusion: SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration and added value of detailed objective accelerometer data in the prediction of clinical events. The translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice is examined during the feasibility study.

N2  - On account of privacy preserving issue and health-care monitoring, physiological signal biometric authentication system has gained popularity in recent years. Seismocardiogram (SCG) is now easily accessible owing to the advance of wearable sensor technology. However, SCG biometric has not been widely explored due to the challenging motion artifact removal. In this paper, we design placing the sensors at different body parts under different activities to determine the best sensor location. In addition, we develop SCG noise removal algorithm and utilize machine learning approach to perform biometric authentication tasks. We validate the proposed methods on 20 healthy young adults. The dataset contains acceleration data of sitting, standing, walking, and sitting post-exercise activities with the sensor placed at the wrists, neck, heart and sternum. We demonstrate that vertical and dorsal-ventral SCG near the heart and the sternum produce reliable SCG biometric evidenced by achieving the state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, we present the efficacy of the devised noise removal procedure in the authentication during walking motion.Clinical relevance- A seismocardiography-based biometric authentication system can help serve privacy preserving and reveal cardiovascular functioning information in clinics.

N2  - Background: In the real world, medical practice is changing hand in hand with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and problems from different areas have been successfully solved using AI algorithms. Specifically, the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver a very much efficient healthcare service. Objective: This article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements. Methods: To that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects. Results: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect. Conclusion: Soon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical activities, improving disease detection and treatment. However, the physician-patient relationship remains a pivotal step.

N2  - Background: Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), but treatment compliance is often unsatisfactory. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for improving CPAP compliance. Methods: This is a prospective, open label, parallel, randomized controlled trial including 60 newly diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP (Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent monitoring system, involving (1) early compliance detection, thus providing measures of patient's CPAP compliance from the very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based prediction of midterm future CPAP compliance; and (3) rule-based recommendations for the patient (app) and care team. Clinical and anthropometric variables, daytime sleepiness, and quality of life were recorded at baseline and after 6 months, together with patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs. Results: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years, mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in the intervention arm had a mean (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23) hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than controls (P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and up to 88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant differences were found in costs (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14) (US $105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 (SD 62.13) (US $112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US $1.17 was considered throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation analysis. Conclusions: A machine learning-based intelligent monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients' empowerment in the management of chronic diseases.

N2  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems.

N2  - Background and objective: E-health is a growing research topic, especially with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. Methods: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. Conclusions: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment.

N2  - COVID-19 exerts deleterious cardiopulmonary effects, leading to a worse prognosis in the most affected. This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring.

N2  - Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation.

N2  - Remote monitoring of physical frailty is important to personalize care for slowing down the frailty process and/or for the healthy recovery of older adults following acute or chronic stressors. Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes.

N2  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.

N2  - Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.

N2  - Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine.

N2  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced cost, and vendor interoperability.

N2  - Objective: We developed a wearable watch-based device to provide noninvasive, cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation in an at-home setting. Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.

N2  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the "Internet of Medical Things" (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. Methods: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. Results: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. Conclusions: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications.

N2  - Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity. During a pandemic such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), it is critical to balance cardiovascular emergencies with infectious risk. In this work, we recommend using wearable device based mobile health (mHealth) as an early screening and real-Time monitoring tool to address this balance and facilitate remote monitoring to tackle this unprecedented challenge. This recommendation may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute CVD patient management while reducing infection risk.

N2  - Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system's feasibility.

N2  - Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying.

N2  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration.

N2  - With the explosive development of smart wearable devices, a serious situation that a large amount of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by electronic discarding needs to be solved urgently. Here, as a throwaway waste material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the troubles of material selections in sensor preparation.

N2  - Objective: To explore the effectiveness of cardiac remote monitoring system (CRMS) based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode for evaluating asymptomatic myocardial ischemia (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Two hundred CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography (CA) in our hospital were included as the study subjects, 120 of whom developed myocardial ischemia (MI). All patients received 12-lead telephone remote ECG monitoring and evaluation. After monitoring, artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm was performed to observe the detection rate of MI. Results: Compared with artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm combined with remote ECG monitoring system, the detection rate of remote ECG monitoring system in 120 MI patients was lower (96.67% vs. 86.67%, P<0.01). Among the 120 MI patients, there were 26 patients (21.67%) with symptomatic myocardial ischemia (SMI) and 94 patients (78.33%) with AMI. There was no difference between the two detection methods in the diagnosis of SMI (P>0.05), while there was a difference in the diagnosis of AMI (P<0.01). The degree and duration of ST segment decline and the threshold variability of MI were higher in SMI patients than those in AMI patients (P<0.001). It showed that the lowest frequency of MI was from 0:00 to 06:00, and the highest from 06:01 to 12:00, with significant difference compared with other time periods (P<0.05). Conclusion: The CRMS based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode can significantly improve the detection rate of AMI. Moreover, small changes of ST segment in AMI patients and circadian rhythm of disease onset were presented.

N2  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

N2  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems are envisioned to provide high-quality healthcare services to patients in the comfort of their home, utilizing cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and medical sensors. Patient comfort and willingness to participate in such efforts is a prominent factor for their adoption. As IoT technology has provided solutions for all technical issues, patient concerns are those that seem to restrict their wider adoption. To enhance patient awareness of the system properties and enhance their willingness to adopt IoMT solutions, this paper presents a novel methodology to integrate patient concerns in the design requirements of such systems. It comprises a number of straightforward steps that an IoMT designer can follow, starting from identifying patient concerns, incorporating them in system design requirements as criticalities, proceeding to system implementation and testing, and finally, verifying that it fulfills the concerns of the patients. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the paper applies it in the design and implementation of a fall detection system for elderly patients remotely monitored in their homes.

N2  - Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring.

N2  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions.

N2  - Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment.

N2  - Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare.

N2  - Background: The response to COVID-19 catalyzed the adoption and integration of digital health tools into the health care delivery model for musculoskeletal patients. The change, suspension, or relaxation of Medicare and federal guidelines enabled the rapid implementation of these technologies. The expansion of payment models for virtual care facilitated its rapid adoption. The authors aim to provide several examples of digital health solutions utilized to manage orthopedic patients during the pandemic and discuss what features of these technologies are likely to continue to provide value to patients and clinicians following its resolution. Conclusion: The widespread adoption of new technologies enabling providers to care for patients remotely has the potential to permanently change the expectations of all stakeholders about the way care is provided in orthopedics. The new era of Digital Orthopaedics will see a gradual and nondisruptive integration of technologies that support the patient's journey through the successful management of their musculoskeletal disease.

N2  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR.

N2  - Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.

N2  - Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time.

N2  - In this paper we proposed a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring system for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection based on a smartphone and cloud computing. A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor's diagnosis for the ECG signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained with 17 selected features achieved an overall F1 score of 0.92 on the test set (n = 7,270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection.

N2  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.

N2  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables.

N2  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.
