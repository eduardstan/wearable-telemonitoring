  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in
               reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the
               efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The
               objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of
               noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF
               rehospitalization. METHODS: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor
               Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure
               Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized
               analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict
               rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were
               monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor
               patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data
               were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics
               platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic
               algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were
               formally adjudicated. RESULTS: One hundred subjects aged
               68.4$\pm$10.2 years (98\% male) were enrolled. After discharge,
               the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of
               expected physiological values. Differences between baseline
               model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were
               used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned
               nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF
               events. The platform was able to detect precursors of
               hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76\% to 88\%
               sensitivity and 85\% specificity. Median time between initial
               alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. CONCLUSIONS:
               Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can
               provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization
               with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The
               clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost
               noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be
               further tested. Registration: URL:

               conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a
               noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy.
               OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an
               artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for
               peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first
               built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using
               retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science
               Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a
               heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female
               patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an
               independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of
               Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum
               cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort
               of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key
               outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver
               operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis
               using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the
               feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture
               single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of
               Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised
               346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this
               cohort, 60\% of participants were Black and 37\% were White,
               with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The
               heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve
               of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the
               heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an
               independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort
               of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest
               Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of
               Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158
               electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model
               achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77-0.89) for this
               data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort
               involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our
               deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94
               (0.91-0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum
               cardiomyopathy diagnosed $\geq$10 days after delivery, the model
               achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81-0.94) for the
               University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96
               (0.93-0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort.
               When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure
               detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we
               obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under
               the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee
               Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist
               cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can
               accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from
               electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic
               artificial intelligence-based peripartum screening could result
               in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead
               electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all
               12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for
               peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture
               single-lead electrocardiogram data.",

              driven by biofilm dysbiosis, remains challenging due to patients'
              poor performance and adherence to the necessary oral hygiene
              procedures. Novel, artificial intelligence-enabled
              multimodal-sensing toothbrushes (AI-MST) can guide patients' oral
              hygiene practices in real-time and transmit valuable data to
              clinicians, thus enabling effective remote monitoring and
              guidance. The aim of this trial was to assess the effect of such
              a system as an adjunct to clinical practice guideline-conform
              treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single-centre,
              double-blind, standard-of-care controlled, randomized,
              parallel-group, superiority trial. Male and female adults with
              generalized Stage II/III periodontitis were recruited at the
              Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, China. Subjects received a
              standard-of-care oral hygiene regimen or a technology-enabled,
              theory-based digital intervention consisting of an AI-MST and
              targeted doctor's guidance by remote micromessaging.
              Additionally, both groups received guideline-conform periodontal
              treatment. The primary outcome was the resolution of inflamed
              periodontal pockets ($\geq$4 mm with bleeding on probing) at 6
              months. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all
              subjects who received the allocated treatment and at least one
              follow-up. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized and
              treated (50 tests/controls) between 1 February and 30 November
              2022. Forty-eight tests (19 females) and 47 controls (16 females)
              were analysed in the ITT population. At 6 months, the proportion
              of inflamed periodontal pockets decreased from 80.7\% (95\%
              confidence interval [CI] 76.5-84.8) to 52.3\% (47.7-57.0) in the
              control group, and from 81.4\% (77.1-85.6) to 44.4\% (39.9-48.9)
              in the test group. The inter-group difference was 7.9\%
              (1.6-14.6, p < .05). Test subjects achieved better levels of oral
              hygiene (p < .001). No significant adverse events were observed.
              CONCLUSIONS: The tested digital health intervention significantly
              improved the outcome of periodontal therapy by enhancing the
              adherence and performance of self-performed oral hygiene. The
              model breaks the traditional model of oral health care and has
              the potential to improve efficiency and reduce costs

               cost-effectiveness of an intelligent monitoring system for
               improving CPAP compliance. METHODS: This is a prospective, open
               label, parallel, randomized controlled trial including 60 newly
               diagnosed patients with OSA requiring CPAP (Apnea-Hypopnea Index
               [AHI] >15) from Lleida, Spain. Participants were randomized
               (1:1) to standard management or the MiSAOS intelligent
               monitoring system, involving (1) early compliance detection,
               thus providing measures of patient's CPAP compliance from the
               very first days of usage; (2) machine learning-based prediction

               patient's compliance, satisfaction, and health care costs.
               RESULTS: Randomized patients had a mean age of 57 (SD 11) years,
               mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13\% (8/60) were women. Patients in

               up to 88\% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness
               to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant

               demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation
               analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based intelligent
               monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent
               patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and
               did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving
               cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of
               intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients
               with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients'

               with COVID-19. (2) Methods: The study will recruit up to 500
               participants (250 cases and 250 controls). Both groups will
               receive the conventional telephone follow-up protocol by primary
               care and will also be provided with access to a mobile
               application, in which they will be able to report their symptoms
               three times a day. In addition, patients in the active group
               will receive a wearable smartwatch and a pulse oximeter at home
               for real-time monitoring. The measured data will be visualized

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The proportion of very old adults in the population
              is increasing, representing a significant challenge. Due to their
              vulnerability, there is a higher frequency of unplanned
              hospitalizations in this population, leading to adverse events.
              Digital tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) can help to
              identify early signs of vulnerability and unfavorable health
              events and can contribute to earlier and optimized management.
              OBJECTIVE: This study aims to report the implementation in
              assisted living facilities of an innovative monitoring system
              (Presage Care) for predicting the short-term risk of emergency
              hospitalization. We describe its use and assess its performance.
              METHODS: An uncontrolled multicenter intervention study was
              conducted between March and August 2022 in 7 assisted living
              facilities in France that house very old and vulnerable adults.
              The monitoring system was set up to provide alerts in cases of a
              high risk of emergency hospitalization. Nurse assistants (NAs) at
              the assisted living facilities used a smartphone app to complete
              a questionnaire on the functional status of the patients,
              comprising electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs);
              these were analyzed in real time by a previously designed machine
              learning algorithm. This remote monitoring of patients using
              ePROMs allowed notification of a coordinating nurse or a
              coordinating NA who subsequently informed the patient's nurses or
              physician. The primary outcomes were the acceptability and
              feasibility of the monitoring system in the context and
              confirmation of the effectiveness and efficiency of AI in risk
              prevention and detection in practical, real-life scenarios. The
              secondary outcome was the hospitalization rate after
              alert-triggered interventions. RESULTS: In this study, 118 of 194
              (61\%) eligible patients were included who had at least 1
              follow-up visit. A total of 38 emergency hospitalizations were
              documented. The system generated 92 alerts for 47 of the 118
              (40\%) patients. Of these 92 alerts, 46 (50\%) led to 46 health
              care interventions for 14 of the 118 (12\%) patients and resulted
              in 4 hospitalizations. The other 46 of the 92 (50\%) alerts did
              not trigger a health care intervention and resulted in 25
              hospitalizations (P<.001). Almost all hospitalizations were
              associated with a lack of alert-triggered interventions (P<.001).
              System performance to predict hospitalization had a high
              specificity (96\%) and negative predictive value (99.4\%).
              CONCLUSIONS: The Presage Care system has been implemented with
              success in assisted living facilities. It was well accepted by
              coordinating nurses and performed well in predicting emergency
              hospitalizations. However, its use by NAs was less than expected.
              Overall, the system performed well in terms of performance and
              clinical impact in this setting. Nevertheless, further work is
              needed to improve the moderate use rate by NAs. TRIAL

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of
              serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits
              require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is
              difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the
              symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions
              are based on clinical grading methods, including the National
              Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical
              Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure
              motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is
              necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers,
              paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and
              dispatches to appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this
              study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for
              stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new
              system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of
              4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by
              medical staff. METHODS: We implemented an automatic grading
              system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a
              grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors
              were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of
              upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with
              kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological
              examination and demographic information of stroke patients with
              NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training
              data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority
              oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of
              data between classes and low number of training data. We trained
              2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a
              support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and
              auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold
              cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30
              trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original
              hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy,
              sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
              characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can
              grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3\% and an AUC of 0.912
              using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an
              accuracy of 80.0\% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM
              algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7\%
              and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of
              78.3\% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification.
              CONCLUSIONS: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal
              weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic
              grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of
              remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system
              can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and
              expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment
              initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between
              prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.",

               poorly understood group of patients both clinically and
               immunologically. We investigated differences in prognosis and
               candidate immune biomarkers in patients with unknown compared
               with those with known primary melanoma enrolled in the E1609
               adjuvant trial that tested ipilimumab at 3 and 10 mg/kg vs
               high-dose interferon-alfa (HDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUP
               status was defined as initial presentation with cutaneous, nodal
               or distant metastasis without a known primary. Relapse-free
               survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by
               the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified (by stage) log-rank test was
               used to compare RFS and OS by primary tumor status. Gene
               expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the tumor biopsies
               of a subset of patients. Similarly, peripheral blood samples
               were tested for candidate soluble and cellular immune
               biomarkers. RESULTS: MUP cases represented 12.8\% of the total
               population (N=1699) including 11.7\% on the ipilimumab arms and
               14.7\% on the HDI arm. Stratifying by stage, RFS (p=0.001) and
               overall survival (OS) (p=0.009) showed outcomes significantly
               better for patients with unknown primary. The primary tumor
               status remained prognostically significant after adjusting for
               treatment and stage in multivariate Cox proportional hazards
               models. Including only ipilimumab-treated patients, RFS
               (p=0.005) and OS (p=0.023) were significantly better in favor of
               those with unknown primary. Among patients with GEP data (n=718;
               102 MUP, 616 known), GEP identified pathways and genes related
               to autoimmunity, inflammation, immune cell infiltration and
               immune activation that were significantly enriched in the MUP
               tumors compared with known primaries. Further investigation into
               infiltrating immune cell types estimated significant enrichment
               with CD8 +and CD4+T cells, B cells and NK cells as well as
               significantly higher major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I
               and MHC-II scores in MUP compared with known primary. Among
               patients tested for circulating biomarkers (n=321; 66 unknown
               and 255 known), patients with MUP had significantly higher
               circulating levels of IL-2R (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with
               MUP and high-risk melanoma had significantly better prognosis
               and evidence of significantly enhanced immune activation within
               the TME and the circulation, supporting the designation of MUP
               as a distinct prognostic marker in patients with high-risk
               melanoma.",
