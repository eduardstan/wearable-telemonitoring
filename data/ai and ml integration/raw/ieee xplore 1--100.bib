  abstract={Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a special purpose wireless sensors network designed to connect various self-autonomous medical sensors and appliances located inside and outside of human body. Interests in human Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) are based on WBAN due to the increasing aging population and chronically ill patients at home. HMS is expected to reduce healthcare expenses by enabling the continuous monitoring of patient’s health remotely in daily life activities. This research focuses on routing protocols in WBAN. The major problems in routing protocols are maximum energy consumption, path loss ratio, packet delivery ratio and maintaining stable signal to noise ratio. Real time analysis is required in HMS to support the patients through doctors, caregivers and hospital systems. Collected data is relayed by using existing wireless communication schemes towards the access point for further retransmission and processing. In this research, an Improved Quality of Service aware Routing Protocol (IM-QRP) is proposed for WBAN based HMS to remotely monitor the elderly people or chronically ill patients in hospitals and residential environments. The proposed protocol is capable to improve 10% residual energy, 30% reduction in path loss ratio, 10% improvement in packet transmission (link reliability) and 7% improvement in SNR as compared to existing CO-LEEBA and QPRD routing protocols. Convolutional Neural Network is used outside the WBAN environment to analyze the medical health records for healthcare diagnosis and intelligent decision-making.},

  pages={3446-3457},
  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient’s data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.},

  pages={97460-97475},
  abstract={New applications like activity tracking and healthcare monitoring depend on secure and timely data transfer using wearable sensors. This work aims to reduce data loss and latency when transmitting wearable sensor information to analysis terminals by introducing an innovative probabilistic transfer learning approach. Using dynamic transmission slot allocation based on risk thresholds and time sensitivity, the suggested method intelligently arranges and prioritizes the transfer of aggregate sensor data across various sources. High-risk data is given preference when allocating slots in a two-step algorithm that divides the data into emergency and normal classifications to guarantee timely delivery without undue delays. Over time, for better activity identification, the transfer model of learning steadily learns and improves the slot assignment accuracy based on feedback. Comprehensive analysis of various queuing scenarios and transmission disruptions shows notable improvements over existing approaches, with waiting times, data loss, and transmission delays reduced by up to 10.49%, 2.42%, and 13.86%, respectively. Most importantly, 3.28% more accuracy is achieved in identifying distinct activities from the supplied wearable sensor data. This can be achieved by the dependable data supply by the probabilistic modelling approach. With its comprehensive architecture for efficiently managing limited communication resources, the suggested approach can provide real-time health surveillance, smart environment services, and other digital-physical systems requiring trustworthy data streaming. More interaction with statistical engines, improvements to security and privacy, and scalability validation on larger distributed platforms are possible areas for future work.},

  abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disease in the elderly. This disease has no cure, but assessing these motor symptoms will help slow down that progression. Inertial sensing-based wearable devices, such as mobile phones and smartwatches have been widely employed to analyze the condition of PD patients. However, most studies purely focused on a single activity or symptom, which may ignore the correlation between activities and complementary characteristics. In this article, a novel technical pipeline is proposed for fine-grained classification of PD severity grades, which identify the most representative activities. We also propose a multiactivities combination scheme based on MDS-UPDRS. Utilizing this scheme, symptom-related and complementary activities are captured. We collected 85 PD subjects of different severity grades using a single wrist sensor. Our best results demonstrate F1 scores of 95.75$\%$ for PD diagnosis and the fine-grained classification accuracy of PD disease grade is 82.41$\%$ when combing four activities which improved by 11.02$\%$ over a single activity. The experiments and theoretical analyses can serve as a useful foundation for future investigations into the effect of proposed solutions for PD diagnosis in uncontrolled environment setup, ultimately leading to self-PD assessment in the home environment.},

  year={2024},

  number={10},
  pages={17317-17329},
  abstract={Medical Internet of Things technology can effectively enable remote physiological data collection, monitoring, and transmission by integrating flexible sensors, wireless communication, and the human body in a wearable and embedded manner. Herein, a stretchable elastomer optical fiber has been developed and sandwiched with two performance of polymethyl methacrylate optical fibers to form a fully flexible polymer optical fiber sensor. The optical fiber integrated with the system mainly consists of a microcomputer, a light-emitting diode (LED) driver, a LED light source, a photodiode, and a Bluetooth module. One intelligent wearable photonic sensing system has been developed based on the Beer–Lambert law of the stretchable elastomer optical fiber for remote healthcare monitoring. Benefiting from the use of elastomer polymer materials, the sensing system features a maximum strain of more than 250%, a high-tensile strain of up to 100%, and a durability of >500 tests. Also, based on the advantage of elastomer optical fiber, the sensing part can be flexibly pasted on the skin surface as a wearable device for real-time monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. In this study, we successfully realized the monitoring of breathing pattern, heart rate, pulse, facial micro-activity, and joint activity, and the recognition of articulatory activity and knee joint activity using a 1-D convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of more than 90% for each activity recognition. Such merits demonstrate its potential as a medical toolkit and indicate promise for remote healthcare monitoring.},

  title={Seven Things to Know About Exercise Classification With Inertial Sensing Wearables}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={28},
  number={6},
  pages={3411-3421},
  abstract={Objective: Exercise monitoring with low-cost wearables could improve the efficacy of remote physical-therapy prescriptions by tracking compliance and informing the delivery of tailored feedback. While a multitude of commercial wearables can detect activities of daily life, such as walking and running, they cannot accurately detect physical-therapy exercises. The goal of this study was to build open-source classifiers for remote physical-therapy monitoring and provide insight on how data collection choices may impact classifier performance. Methods: We trained and evaluated multi-class classifiers using data from 19 healthy adults who performed 37 exercises while wearing 10 inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the chest, pelvis, wrists, thighs, shanks, and feet. We investigated the effect of sensor density, location, type, sampling frequency, output granularity, feature engineering, and training-data size on exercise-classification performance. Results: Exercise groups (n = 10) could be classified with 96% accuracy using a set of 10 IMUs and with 89% accuracy using a single pelvis-worn IMU. Multiple sensor modalities (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), high sampling frequencies, and more data from the same population did not improve model performance, but in the future data from diverse populations and better feature engineering could. Conclusions: Given the growing demand for exercise monitoring systems, our sensitivity analyses, along with open-source tools and data, should reduce barriers for product developers, who are balancing accuracy with product formfactor, and increase transparency and trust in clinicians and patients.},

  abstract={ICU readmission is usually associated with an increased number of hospital death. Predicting readmission helps to reduce such risks by avoiding early discharge, providing appropriate intervention, and planning for patient placement after ICU discharge. Unfortunately, ICU scores such as the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health (APACHE) could help predict mortality or evaluate illness severity. Still, it is ineffective in predicting ICU readmission. This study introduces a clinical monitoring fog-computing-based system for remote prognosis and monitoring of intensive care patients. This proposed monitoring system uses the advantages of machine learning (ML) approaches for generating a real-time alert signal to doctors for supplying e-healthcare, accelerating decision-making, and monitoring and controlling health systems. The proposed system includes three main layers. First, the data acquisition layer, in which we collect the vital signs and lab tests of the patient’s health conditions in real-time. Then, the fog computing layer processes. The results are then sent to the cloud layer, which offers sizable storage space for patient healthcare. Demographic data, lab tests, and vital signs are aggregated from the MIMIC III dataset for 10,465 patients. Feature selection methods: Genetic algorithm (GA) and practical swarm optimization (PSO) are used to choose the optimal feature subset from detests. Moreover, Different traditional ML models, ensemble learning models, and the proposed stacking models are applied to full features and selected features to predict readmission after 30 days of ICU discharge. The proposed stacking models recorded the highest performance compared to other models. The proposed stacking ensemble model with selected features by POS achieved promising results (accuracy = 98.42, precision = 98.42, recall = 98.42, and F1-Score = 98.42), compared to full features and selected features. We also, provide model explanations to ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and trust in the developed model through local and global explanations.},

  abstract={Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), which leverages the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and autonomous systems, has grown in popularity recently. In RPM, the IoMT sense a patient’s biophysical data and transmits it in real time while the autonomous system processes the data for clinical notifications and storage. However, RPM deployments face two diverse challenges: how to present continuous data so that healthcare professionals can quickly interpret data streams and how to manage a great deal of missing data that occurs in RPM. Several studies suggested techniques for imputing missing data in static databases, which are unsuitable for RPM. A method for constantly streaming healthcare data to medical experts involves summarizing vital signs information into a numerical score, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which may be visually displayed to highlight MEWS patterns over a certain period. However, a MEWS chart is simplistic and more sophisticated ways to present data visually for straightforward interpretation are needed. This research proposes a solution for the visualization and missing data challenges by identifying patterns in the RPM data. First, a pattern-matching technique is proposed to address the missing data by considering the correlation and variability of the vital signs, resulting in a comparable correct match rate. Second, we transform the observed raw physiological vital signs data into concepts we call trust, frequency, trend, and slope parameters for visualization and automated alerts. The proposed approach can better support clinical decision-making than the MEWS. Comprehensive visualization approaches and missing data solutions can improve the quality and dependability of patient risk assessments.},

  abstract={Remote healthcare and telemedicine technology have witnessed a large and rapid development in the last decade with the large development of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, where various types of medical sensors are aggregated for measuring medical parameters and transmitting them anywhere. Smart portable products can now be used to monitor different medical aspects to track human health. Also, they can be used in the prediagnosis of various diseases and in detecting abnormalities of organ functionality. In this article, we design and implement a multifunction and portable health monitoring system, which can help in daily medical inspections. The developed system monitors various medical aspects: heart rate (HR), blood oxygen saturation level (SpO2), body temperature, photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, electrocardiography (ECG) signal, room temperature, and room humidity. The obtained measurements are displayed on the built-in display or transmitted over Wi-Fi to either a mobile application, in the local mode, or to the cloud storage for remote monitoring. The developed system can be used to keep an eye on the people we need to care about, while keeping them in their normal daily life. The maximum error percentage of the proposed system is reported as 2.67%, 2.04%, and 1.58% for HR, SpO2, and body temperature, respectively, compared to commercial devices. In addition, statistical tests were performed and they showed a high level of agreement between the observed and the reference measurements.

  abstract={Over the years, the popularity and usage of wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices in several healthcare services are increased. Among the services that benefit from the usage of such devices is predictive analysis, which can improve early diagnosis in e-health. However, due to the limitations of wearable IoT devices, challenges in data privacy, service integrity, and network structure adaptability arose. To address these concerns, we propose a platform using federated learning and private blockchain technology within a fog-IoT network. These technologies have privacy-preserving features securing data within the network. We utilized the fog-IoT network’s distributive structure to create an adaptive network for wearable IoT devices. We designed a testbed to examine the proposed platform’s ability to preserve the integrity of a classifier. According to experimental results, the introduced implementation can effectively preserve a patient’s privacy and a predictive service’s integrity. We further investigated the contributions of other technologies to the security and adaptability of the IoT network. Overall, we proved the feasibility of our platform in addressing significant security and privacy challenges of wearable IoT devices in predictive healthcare through analysis, simulation, and experimentation.},

  abstract={Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.},

  abstract={This article introduces an advanced vital sign monitoring system that seamlessly integrates sensor technology, wireless communication, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance patient care. The system accurately records and interprets vital physiological metrics such as oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and body temperature. The integration forms the foundation of our comprehensive approach to patient health status classification through the ML algorithm. We employed three distinct ML algorithms—K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models to analyze health states, each precisely trained and validated using data collected from sensors on vital sign. This meticulous training aims to enable the models to accurately identify various patient health states, with the KNN model achieving an average accuracy of 92%, while the SVM and SGD models attained even higher accuracies of 94% and 97%, respectively. These outcomes were rigorously validated against established health scoring systems, showcasing the models’ exceptional performance in multiclass classification scenarios. This is further evidenced by their area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores: KNN (0.9021), SVM (0.9841), and SGD (0.9933). The integration of these technologies into our health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in the continuous and comprehensive assessment of patient health, demonstrating the potential of modern technologies to revolutionize healthcare monitoring and management.},

While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

  abstract={In many sectors, including healthcare services, Internet of Things (IoT) systems are growing rapidly, providing promising technological, economical, and social potential. Healthcare services can be improved with IoT capabilities, including remote patient monitoring, diagnosis of medical issues in real-time, and more, all of which improves both the quality and the satisfaction of human users. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining momentum as wearable devices, and their numerous health monitoring applications increase popularity. The IoMT plays a significant role in reducing death rates by detecting diseases early. Prediction of heart disease is an essential challenge in clinical dataset analysis. The proposed research aim is to employ machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to predict heart disease. The IoMT-based cloud-fog diagnostics for heart disease have been proposed. Fog layer is used to quickly analyze patient data using ML classification techniques. The performance of the healthcare model is evaluated with different simulations and achieves 97.32% accuracy, 97.58% recall, 97.16% precision, 97.37%  $F1$ -measure, 96.87% specificity, and 97.22%  $G$ -mean, which has significant improvement as compared with previous models.},

  abstract={Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.},

  abstract={Motor symptoms such as tremor and bradykinesia can develop concurrently in Parkinson’s disease; thus, the ideal home monitoring system should be capable of tracking symptoms continuously despite background noise from daily activities. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting symptom episodes in a free-living scenario, providing a higher level of interpretability to aid AI-powered decision-making. Machine learning models trained on wearable sensor data from scripted activities performed by participants in the lab and clinician ratings of the video recordings of these tasks identified tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in the supervised lab environment with a balanced accuracy of 83%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, when compared to the clinician ratings. The performance of the same models when evaluated on data from subjects performing unscripted activities unsupervised in their own homes achieved a balanced accuracy of 63%, 63%, and 67%, respectively, in comparison to self-assessment patient diaries, further highlighting their limitations. The ankle-worn sensor was found to be advantageous for the detection of dyskinesias but did not show an added benefit for tremor and bradykinesia detection here.},

  abstract={The rise in chronic diseases and the aging of the population led to an increase in the demand for remote healthcare systems that employ biosensors to monitor people’s health status. The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient’s health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors. The performance evaluation shows that the MuDaFuDeC outperforms other approaches in terms of the data reduction percentage and energy consumption. It keeps a good representation of all the scores at the fog gateway and makes automated, fast, and accurate decisions based on the patient’s condition.},

  abstract={Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients’ needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals’ behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients’ behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures.},

  abstract={The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via `3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise `2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES.},

Motivated by this, authors have presented a secure, lightweight authentication technique for smart health environments for a remote monitoring scenario employing a Multiple Factor approach and a lightweight algorithm. The scheme is verified through formal and informal analysis. The scheme demonstrated enhanced authentication performance and security with processing overhead of (0.04 milliseconds) and transmission overhead of (704 bits), in comparison to the baseline scheme. This system has the potential to improve data security and privacy in a variety of smart health scenarios.},

  abstract={Modern wearable healthcare devices require new technologies with resource efficiency in terms of high performance, low energy consumption and diagnostic accuracy. In the field of artificial intelligence, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has performed as an effective algorithm. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively utilised to construct hardware accelerators for CNNs. This paper suggests using an accelerator to create a specific 1-D CNN to classify the electrogram (ExG). ExGs used here include electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyography. The pipelined structure is designed with a register in the middle to facilitate easy data transfer. A 1-D CNN using an accelerator to categorise ExG signals implemented on Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 platform outperforms FPGA peer applications on the same platform by  $1.14\times $  in terms of speed. In addition, the 1-D CNN proposed accelerator operates very efficiently due to the use of a tristate buffer in the multiplexer and the substitution of the shift for the multiplier, resulting in a resource-efficient accelerator with 161 GOP/s/W energy efficiency and 28 GOP/s/KLUT, an improvement of 1.67 over the previous model. Finally, the performance of the accelerator applied to a Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 FPGA operating at 442.948MHz was calculated, achieving 1.145 TFLOP/s.},

  abstract={Complex sensor arrays prohibit practical deployment of existing wearables-based algorithms for free-living analysis of muscle and joint mechanics. Machine learning techniques have been proposed as a potential solution, however, they are less interpretable and generalizable when compared to physics-based techniques. Herein, we propose a hybrid method utilizing inertial sensor- and electromyography (EMG)-driven simulation of muscle contraction to characterize knee joint and muscle mechanics during walking gait. Machine learning is used only to map a subset of measured muscle excitations to a full set thereby reducing the number of required sensors. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for estimating net knee flexion moment (KFM) as well as individual muscle moment and work during the stance phase of gait across nine unimpaired subjects. Across all subjects, KFM was estimated with 0.91%BW•H RMSE and strong correlations (r = 0.87) compared to ground truth inverse dynamics analysis. Estimates of individual muscle moments were strongly correlated (r = 0.81–0.99) with a reference EMG-driven technique using optical motion capture and a full set of electrodes as were estimates of muscle work (r = 0.88–0.99). Implementation of the proposed technique in the current work included instrumenting only three muscles with surface electrodes (lateral and medial gastrocnemius and vastus medialis) and both the thigh and shank segments with inertial sensors. These sensor locations permit instrumentation of a knee brace/sleeve facilitating a practically deployable mechanism for monitoring muscle and joint mechanics with performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art.},

The proposed model is designed by exploiting the deep learning framework of Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN), exhibiting inherent ability of feature extraction, thereby, eliminating the cost effective steps of feature selection and extraction, making less-complex for deployment on resource constrained platforms such as mobile platforms. The performance demonstration of the PP-Net is done on a larger and publically available MIMIC-II database. We achieved an average NMAE of 0.09 (DBP) and 0.04 (SBP) mmHg for BP, and 0.046 bpm for HR estimation on total population of 1557 critically ill subjects. The accurate estimation of HR and BP on a larger population compared to the existing methods, demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed deep learning framework. The accurate evaluation on a huge population with CVD complications, validates the robustness of the proposed framework in pervasive healthcare monitoring especially cardiac and stroke rehabilitation monitoring.},

Big data is built with the possibility to improve the healthcare industry. Big data makes the interconnection between patients, wearable sensors, healthcare caregivers, and providers through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and software. Most of the economic challenges in developing countries are caused by the healthcare sector, which occurs predominantly due to the increasing population requiring more quality of care concerning older people. Older people need great attention and care as they lead with irreparable damages when a minor accident or insignificant disease occurs. Therefore, the necessity of implementing new technologies and tools has arisen to support senior citizens regarding their healthcare. Various advancements in wireless technology, miniaturization, computing power, and processing made diverse healthcare innovations that led to developing the connected medical devices. Hence, this proposal develops a new healthcare monitoring system for tracking the activities of elderly people, where the Hadoop MapReduce technique for parallel processing the large-sized data. The data collected as mentioned in the available datasets is performed by using the numerous wearable sensors fixed on the “subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest” that are transformed to the cloud platform and also to the data analytics layer according to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The given input undergoes data splitting to produce tiny chunks. These small chunks of the input files are then considered as Map tasks. Here, in the map phase, the features are optimally selected by the Hybrid Dingo Coyote Optimization (HDCO). The combiner phase classifies the physical activities using the developed Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) consisting of classifiers such as “Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)”. The parameter tuning in these classifiers is done by the same HDCO. The reducer phase extracts data from different chunks by merging the same classes. The developed HDCO-DEL has secured 13.66%, 16.01%, 17.33%, 13.6%, and 14.01% better accuracy than ELM, CNN, LSTM, DBN, DNN, and HealthFog, respectively on second dataset. The comparison with existing methods shows its better performance and also predicts physical activities with overall high accuracy.},

  abstract={In this article, we propose a smart bedsheet—i-Sheet—for remotely monitoring the health of COVID-19 patients. Typically, real-time health monitoring is very crucial for COVID-19 patients to prevent their health from deteriorating. Conventional healthcare monitoring systems are manual and require patient input to start monitoring health. However, it is difficult for the patients to give input in critical conditions as well as at night. For instance, if the oxygen saturation level decreases during sleep, then it is difficult to monitor. Furthermore, there is a need for a system that monitors post-COVID effects as various vitals get affected, and there are chances of their failure even after the recovery. i-Sheet exploits these features and provides the health monitoring of COVID-19 patients based on their pressure on the bedsheet. It works in three phases: 1) sensing the pressure exerted by the patient on the bedsheet; 2) categorizing the data into groups (comfortable and uncomfortable) based on the fluctuations in the data; and 3) alerting the caregiver about the condition of the patient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of i-Sheet in monitoring the health of the patient. i-Sheet effectively categorizes the condition of the patient with an accuracy of 99.3% and utilizes 17.5 W of the power. Furthermore, the delay involved in monitoring the health of patients using i-Sheet is 2 s which is very diminutive and is acceptable.},

  pages={103513-103523},
  abstract={Cardiovascular diseases are considered the number one cause of death across the globe which can be primarily identified by the abnormal heart rhythms of the patients. By generating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can consistently track the patient's heart rhythms. Although Cloud-based approaches for ECG analysis can achieve some levels of accuracy, they still have some limitations, such as high latency. Conversely, the Fog computing infrastructure is more powerful than edge devices but less capable than Cloud computing for executing compositionally intensive data analytic software. The Fog infrastructure can consist of Fog-based gateways directly connected with the wearable devices to offer many advanced benefits, including low latency and high quality of services. To address these issues, a modular one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) approach is proposed in this work. The inference module of the proposed approach is deployable over the Fog infrastructure for analysing the ECG signals and initiating the emergency countermeasures within a minimum delay, whereas its training module is executable on the computationally enriched Cloud data centers. The proposed approach achieves the F1-measure score ≈1 on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database when applying GridSearch algorithm with the cross-validation method. This approach has also been implemented on a single-board computer and Google Colab-based hybrid Fog-Cloud infrastructure and embodied to a remote patient monitoring system that shows 25% improvement in the overall response time.},

  title={Internet of Things and Deep Learning Enabled Elderly Fall Detection Model for Smart Homecare}, 
  year={2021},

  pages={113879-113888},
  abstract={Recently, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to gather human and environment information data for a variety of intelligent services and applications. Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.},

  year={2022},
  volume={69},
  number={8},
  pages={2443-2455},
  abstract={Objective: Tracking changes in hemodynamic congestion and the consequent proactive readjustment of treatment has shown efficacy in reducing hospitalizations for patients with heart failure (HF). However, the cost-prohibitive nature of these invasive sensing systems precludes their usage in the large patient population affected by HF. The objective of this research is to estimate the changes in pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAM) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) following vasodilator infusion during right heart catheterization (RHC), using changes in simultaneously recorded wearable seismocardiogram (SCG) signals captured with a small wearable patch. Methods: A total of 20 patients with HF (20% women, median age 55 (interquartile range (IQR), 44-64) years, ejection fraction 24 (IQR, 16-43)) were fitted with a wearable sensing patch and underwent RHC with vasodilator challenge. We divided the dataset randomly into a training–testing set (n = 15) and a separate validation set (n = 5). We developed globalized (population) regression models to estimate changes in PAM and PCWP from the changes in simultaneously recorded SCG. Results: The regression model estimated both pressures with good accuracies: root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.5 mmHg and R2 of 0.83 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 1.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.93 for estimating changes in PCWP for the training-testing set, and RMSE of 2.7 mmHg and R2 of 0.81 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 2.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.95 for estimating changes in PCWP for the validation set respectively. Conclusion: Changes in wearable SCG signals may be used to track acute changes in intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with HF. Significance: This method holds promise in tracking longitudinal changes in hemodynamic congestion in hemodynamically-guided remote home monitoring and treatment for patients with HF.},

  abstract={In next-generation network architecture, the Cybertwin drove the sixth generation of cellular networks sixth-generation (6G) to play an active role in many applications, such as healthcare and computer vision. Although the previous sixth-generation (5G) network provides the concept of edge cloud and core cloud, the internal communication mechanism has not been explained with a specific application. This article introduces a possible Cybertwin based multimodal network (beyond 5G) for electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns monitoring during daily activity. This network paradigm consists of a cloud-centric network and several Cybertwin communication ends. The Cybertwin nodes combine support locator/identifier identification, data caching, behavior logger, and communications assistant in the edge cloud. The application focuses on monitoring the ECG patterns during daily activity because few studies analyze them under different motions. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based human activity recognition classifier to enhance identification accuracy. The healthcare monitoring values and potential clinical medicine are provided by the Cybertwin based network for ECG patterns observing.},

  year={2022},
  volume={14},
  number={2},
  pages={1-17},
  abstract={To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring.},

Herein, we present HealthDAR, a low-cost, contactless, and easy-to-deploy health monitoring system. Specifically, HealthDAR encompasses three interventions: 1) symptom early detection (monitoring of vital signs and cough detection); 2) tracking and social distancing; and 3) preventive measures (monitoring of daily activities, such as face-touching and hand-washing). HealthDAR has three key components: 1) a low-cost, low-energy, and compact integrated radar system; 2) a simultaneous signal processing combined deep learning (SSPDL) network for cough detection; and 3) a deep learning method for the classification of daily activities. Through performance tests involving multiple subjects across uncontrolled environments, we demonstrate HealthDAR’s practical utility for health monitoring.},

  abstract={The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches.},

  year={2022},
  volume={10},

  pages={23964-23979},
  abstract={More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems.},

  abstract={Early diagnosis of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, HIV, AIDS, Lyme, and tuberculosis can enable timely treatment, which enhances efficacy and helps reduce the severity and mortality while lowering overall healthcare costs. Predictive analytics is an emerging approach that comprehends trends in patient data to identify patterns in patient data, detect subtle signs of diseases, and enable early diagnosis for more effective treatment. However, traditional predictive diagnosis approaches rely on statistical models that are contingent on the data’s average pattern and are unable to capture the data’s inherent patterns, leading to ineffective and inaccurate diagnoses. In this paper, we introduce a novel Artificial Spider Monkey-based Random Forest (ASM-RF) hybrid framework that combines the predictive analytics of a Random Forest algorithm with Artificial Intelligence to evaluate patient health data, spot patterns, diagnose modest indications, and automate intelligent decisions for enhancing the healthcare system. The proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework employs a fitness function to evaluate the spider monkey’s performance at the classification layer and update accuracy and recall, resulting in more accurate patient disease diagnoses and automating timely treatment decisions for improving the overall healthcare system. Moreover, we use Identity-based Encryption (IBE), which enables the encryption of data with private and public keys coupled with users’ identities as the encryption keys, assisting in enhancing the security of the healthcare system. A dataset collected from three different IoT sensor devices, ten participants, and twelve activities is employed to simulate the proposed ASM-RF hybrid framework, which is then contrasted to cutting-edge predictive diagnostic algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, Area under the Curve, execution time, recall, and F-measure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance when compared to conventional methods, as evidenced by its exceptional accuracy (99.52%), precision (99.12%), Area Under the Curve (AUC) (99.00%), recall (99.22%), F-measure (97.12%), and significantly reduced execution time (6s).},

  pages={15943-15952},
  abstract={Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect severe medical events, such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders. Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home.},

  title={Longitudinal Trend Monitoring of Multiple Sclerosis Ambulation Using Smartphones}, 
  year={2022},
  volume={3},

  pages={202-210},
  abstract={Goal: Smartphone and wearable devices may act as powerful tools to remotely monitor physical function in people with neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases from out-of-clinic environments. Detection of progression onset or worsening of symptoms is especially important in people living with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) in order to enable optimally adapted therapeutic strategies. MS symptoms typically follow subtle and fluctuating disease courses, patient-to-patient, and over time. Current in-clinic assessments are often too infrequently administered to reflect longitudinal changes in MS impairment that impact daily life. This work, therefore, explores how smartphones can administer daily two-minute walking assessments to monitor PwMS physical function at home. Methods: Remotely collected smartphone inertial sensor data was transformed through state-of-the-art Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, to estimate a participant's daily ambulatory-related disease severity, longitudinally over a 24-week study. Results: This study demonstrated that smartphone-based ambulatory severity outcomes could accurately estimate MS level of disability, as measured by the EDSS score ($r^{2}$: 0.56,$p< $0.001). Furthermore, longitudinal severity outcomes were shown to accurately reflect individual participants' level of disability over the study duration. Conclusion: Smartphone-based assessments, that can be performed by patients from their home environments, could greatly augment standard in-clinic outcomes for neurodegenerative diseases. The ability to understand the impact of disease on daily-life between clinical visits, through objective digital outcomes, paves the way forward to better measure and identify signs of disease progression that may be occurring out-of-clinic, to monitor how different patients respond to various treatments, and to ultimately enable the development of better, and more personalised care.},

  abstract={The real-time and accurate detection of premature ventricular contractions (PVC) in patients is of great significance for preventing the occurrence of high-risk events such as sudden cardiac death and guiding cardiac surgical procedures such as radiofrequency ablation. To improve the diagnostic accuracy and real-time performance, and expand application scenarios, an economical wearable PVC real-time auxiliary diagnosis system based on the multi-parameter squeeze excitation residual network (MP-SE-ResNet) is proposed. We have realized the real-time acquisition, processing, and wireless transmission of dynamic ECGs based on ESP32, furthermore, realized the PVCs recognition based on MP-SE-ResNet. Using the lead-II ECGs in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia databases as training samples, and the network was evaluated using the remainder of this dataset and data recorded by our device, respectively. The accuracy of the MIT-BIH dataset reached 99.34%, and the sensitivity and specificity of PVC recognition reached 98.26% and 99.64%, respectively. Using the ECGs recorded by our system, we achieved the following results: the accuracy was 94.07%, the sensitivity and specificity of PVC were 92.76% and 97.63%, respectively.

  abstract={These days cloud-based infrastructure is facing many challenges, out of which the major issue is their syncing data before cutover and data migration. Due to the limited scalability in terms of security concerns of cloud computing, the need for a centralized IoTs based environment has been constrained to a limited extent. The sensitivity of device latency emerged during healthy systems such as health monitoring, etc. is the main reason, because healthy systems require computing operations on high-volume data. Fog computing provides an innovative solution to improve the performance of cloud computing, providing the ability to take the necessary resources and those that are closer to the end-users. Existing fog computing models retain several limitations, such as either considering result accuracy or overestimating response time, but managing both together impairs system compatibility. FETCH is a proposed framework that integrates with edge computing devices to work on deep learning technology and automated monitoring and offers a highly useful framework for real-life health care systems such as heart disease and more. The proposed Fog-enabled cloud computing framework uses FogBus, which demonstrates utility in the form of consumption of power, network bandwidth, jitter, latency, process execution time, and their accuracy as well.},

The sensor’s ability to provide accurate and real-time health data without the need for invasive procedures is a major benefit, making it easier for individuals to monitor their health and for healthcare professionals to gather vital patient data in a variety of settings [51]. The Wireless Body Sensor Network Device, illustrated in Fig. 3, is ingeniously designed with three core components for advanced health monitoring. It utilizes two sophisticated sensors: the MAX-30102 for monitoring vital signs, including blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and the MLX90614 for noninvasive body temperature measurement.

  volume={69},

  pages={1461-1468},
  abstract={Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.},

  abstract={The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user’s wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.},

  abstract={Recent advances in Internet-of-Things technology have opened the doors to new scenarios for biosensor applications. Flexibility, portability, and remote control and access are of utmost importance to move these devices to people’s homes or in a Point-of-Care context and rapidly share the results with users and their physicians. In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semi-quantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23%. Finally, COVID-19 related tests are presented and discussed.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.},

  abstract={People suffering from chronic diseases require continuous support in monitoring their nutrition, diagnostic tests, medication, and daily activity tracking. Given the low ratio of patients to healthcare providers, it becomes infeasible to provide one-to-one support to patients. Furthermore the existing online medical consultation platforms are costly for regular approach. Addressing these issues, we propose to monitor and assist patients suffering from chronic disease using a novel Al-based and IoT-supported digital twin platform. A digital twin of a patient grows with the patient, and it helps in continuous and remote patient monitoring. Further, the digital twin enables the creation of patient-specific personalized treatment models, enabling doctors to conduct virtual simulations of the suitability of certain drugs and procedures. The data collected from the digital twin is fed to machine learning models for intelligent analysis, feedback, and support. The proposed solution incorporates five essential machine learning models using novel algorithms for drug recommendation, chronic disease stage detection, nutrition tracking and recommendation, patient activity tracking, and patient data anonymization. Addressing patients' lack of motivation to participate in emerging patient monitoring frameworks, we incorporate an incentive mechanism rooted in Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to encourage active participation in patients, which also has the added benefit of helping patients to store their historical medical data securely.},

  abstract={This article explores the profound changes in healthcare catalyzed by the advent of sensor-based platforms, ushering in a transformative era for disease monitoring and holistic health tracking. These technologies, underpinned by advancements in sensor miniaturization and innovative human activity recognition approaches, offer a nuanced approach to monitoring habits within the familiar confines of the home. However, the practical utility of these advancements is challenged by the lack of standardized methodology to seamlessly adapt and deploy them in clinical contexts. To overcome this challenge, this article has three pivotal objectives. First, it introduces a tailored methodology for developing adherence platforms, through the active participation of different stakeholders, to monitor healthy habits in different patient households. Second, it introduces a specialized platform designed to monitor adherence at home for patients with diabetes, all within the confines of the aforementioned methodology. A comparison with other treatment adherence platforms on the market is also carried out. Lastly, this article engages in a thoughtful discussion on prospective research avenues and navigates inherent challenges associated with implementing and refining these adherence computing platforms. Therefore, our work not only emphasizes the revolutionary impact of sensor-based healthcare platforms but also addresses the pressing need for standardized methodologies and platforms attuned to specific health conditions. By drafting a comprehensive road map for the future, this article endeavors to propel the evolution of home-based healthcare monitoring, indicating a pivotal paradigm shift in patient care.},

  abstract={Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.},

  abstract={Human-Object Interaction (HOI) recognition, due to its significance in many computer vision-based applications, requires in-depth and meaningful details from image sequences. Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%. The proposed system is validated via extensive experimentation and should be applicable to many computer-vision based applications such as healthcare monitoring, security systems and assisted living etc.},

  abstract={Considering the increasing growth of communicable diseases worldwide such as COVID-19, it is recommended to stay at home for patients with fewer chronic health problems. In recent times, the high chance of COVID-19 spread and the lack of an excellent remote monitoring system make the situation challenging for hospital administrators. Inspired by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a new edge-centric healthcare framework for remote health monitoring and disease prediction using Wearable Sensors (WSs) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) model, namely Bag-of-Neural Network (BoNN), respectively. The epidemic model collects the health symptoms of the patient using various a set of WSs and preprocesses the data in distributed edge devices for preparing a useful dataset. Finally, the proposed BoNN model is applied over the refined dataset for detecting COVID-19 disease at centralized cloud servers using a set of random neural networks. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed BoNN model over the standard ML models, the system is fine-tuned and trained over a synthetic COVID-19 dataset before being evaluated on a benchmark Brazil COVID-19 dataset using various performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BoNN model achieves 99.8% accuracy while analyzing the Brazil dataset.},

  abstract={Intravenous (IV) therapy provides a rapid therapeutic effect. However, errors in infusion rate can lead to over-dosing and under-dosing, potentially causing severe side effects for patients. To prevent incidents, medical staff visually monitors medication injection information (MIF) such as current flow rates (CFR) and injection volume. In this study, we propose an internet of things (IoT) system that automatically controls the CFR and remotely monitors the MIF. First, a peristaltic pump is designed to infuse parenteral fluids based on the “drop-by-drop” phenomenon. Second, a computer vision-based on deep learning algorithm provides real-time video and counts the fluid dropping to derive the MIF. Finally, the CFR is automatically applied as a feedback signal to regulate the infusion cycle of the peristaltic pump. After embedding all systems in our prototype, we evaluate the system performance according to IV therapy protocols used in clinical practice. In our experiments, the mean accuracy of the fluid injection using the peristaltic pump was 99.23% and the dropping count was the highest at 98.25%. Furthermore, the average accuracy of the CFR using the feedback system was 99.3%. Based on our results, we confirmed that automated control of infusion rate is possible in IV therapy and computer vision-based on deep learning can be utilized for feedback sensors and monitoring system. Therefore, we believe that our method is the practical solution that can increase patient safety and work efficiency of clinical staffs.},

  abstract={Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is an attractive solution for non-contact vital sign monitoring due to its characteristics of robustness against noise, interference, and high-range resolutions. However, due to the attenuation of mmWave signal strength with distance, most previous methods require users to be relatively close to the radar (<2.5m), and the estimation of vital signs is inaccurate due to the influence of surrounding objects. In this paper, we propose a vital sign remote monitoring method based on mmWave sensing, which can estimate the heart rate of multiple users at a long distance. We first propose an object location detection method based on windowing minimum variance distortionless response to enhance the signal SNR from weak human body reflections and obtain fine-grained each user’s location. Then we design a vital sign estimation method based on wavelet packet decomposition to extract precision vital signs from composite reflection signals. We evaluate the system performance and the impact of different factors, including the distance, angle, and multi-user scenario. Experimental results show that our method can achieve the heart rate accurately with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.5Bpm and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4% within 8m.},

In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.},

  abstract={A methodology for daily physical activity tracking, detection, and classification is proposed using wearable ultrawideband (UWB) technology. The compact UWB antennas act as sensors to provide useful information and metrics regarding the activity, derived from channel information (path loss and rms delay spread) and received signal features. The activities consist of daily activities, such as walking, sitting, running, opening/closing door, and ascending/descending stairs, which are considered as main activities in everyday life. Experimental validation is carried out showing effective tracking capabilities based on the interdistance variation, giving an estimate of the range of movement during various phases of the activity cycle. The computation of patterns of different daily activities cycle provides unique recognition/classification characteristics, which have been validated through template-based and machine learning techniques. The proposed method provides high accuracy, is cost-effective, and has low computation complexity, making it suitable for various healthcare applications, such as elderly/remote monitoring, rehabilitation, patient activity tracking, and general fitness.},

  abstract={The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.},

  abstract={As a vital sign of human, ballistocardiography (BCG) signal is widely used to indicate the health status of an individual. It can be captured by optical fiber sensor in a non-invasive way. Besides, some significant physiological information, such as heart rate (HR) and respiration rate (RR), can also be extracted from BCG signal. As a medical instrument characterized by low power consumption, no interference, no invasion and the capability of real-time health monitoring, optical fiber sensor provides an effective solution to health care monitoring. However, when long-term monitoring of HR and RR is required for patients, it is necessary to collect a large amount of BCG data, which incurs a considerable amount of time and labor costs. To solve this problem, a novel deep learning model is proposed in this paper, namely ELA. Long-short term memory (LSTM) has the capability to memorize long-distance information states. According to this method, the improved empirical mode decomposition (EMD) algorithm (VEMD) is applied to convert the complex problem of HR and RR time series prediction into multiple sub-problems with relatively simple intrinsic mode function (IMF) component sequence prediction. Then, the proposed ELA model is adopted to model the HR and RR sub-sequences decomposed by VEMD. Accordingly, the results of IMF component subsequence prediction are obtained, with all the prediction results linearly summed to obtain the final prediction result. Moreover, experimental results are obtained to demonstrate the superiority of ELA and the R2 is 0.9946, indicating the excellent performance of the proposed model in the assessment and prediction of vital signs.},

  abstract={Due to the expanding growth of populations worldwide, infectious disease expenses are increasing rapidly. Patients with lesser chronic health problems are often encouraged to recover at home, which requires continuous remote monitoring and recommendation systems for decision-making. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges and reduce connectivity between infected patients and medical officers, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based healthcare prototype in edge networks to monitor and analyze health parameters remotely. In the first phase of the work, health parameters are collected through multiple biosensors, including temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, and stored at the edge of the network. In the second phase, the monitoring data are preprocessed and analyzed using the neural network (NN) model in the edge devices for decision-making about the health status of the infected patient. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a real-time dataset, and multiple performance metrics are collected from the developed prototype to assess its effectiveness. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model over the existing ML models, i.e., the NN model achieves 94.05% accuracy, which is higher than the existing ones.},

  abstract={In the midst of a global health crisis, it is of utmost importance for healthcare technologies to possess the capability to regulate and monitor the physiological variables of patients remotely and automatically. The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient’s MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller’s coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor’s policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate.},

  abstract={Smart homecare utilises advanced technologies to support, improve and promote remote healthcare in homes and communities through collecting and analysing health data and sharing this knowledge with carers and clinicians. With the continuous growth in the world’s older population, smart homecare becomes increasingly crucial in providing in-home care for older adults, allowing the vital healthcare dollars to go further into other critical care needs. In addition, with the rise in the development and utilisation of innovative technologies in healthcare settings, it is vital to ensure that these technologies are guided and approved by the corresponding regulatory bodies such as FDA (Foods and Drug Administration) in the USA and TGA (Therapeutic Good Administration) in Australia. With this premise, this paper identifies four dimensions for researchers to consider when developing smart homecare solutions for in-home remote care: Technology, Data, People, and Operational Environment. The essential interplays amongst these four dimensions are discussed to identify the various enablers and barriers in the successful delivery of smart homecare solutions. As the primary output of this paper, it proposes a conceptual framework to achieve practical in-home care for the older population living independently with the support of technology, while addressing the challenges such as security and privacy of patient data. Secondly, a comprehensive and practical guide featuring seven phases is presented to support and direct researchers in implementing smart homecare solutions for remote care. The proposed framework and the guide aim to make smart homecare research practical and truly translational into broader practice.},

  abstract={Identifying correct human postures is crucial in areas, such as patient care, in hospitals. However, the traditional vision-based methods widely used for this purpose raise privacy concerns for the subject, and the other wearable sensor-based approaches are impractical for real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose a contactless, privacy-conscious, and memory-efficient posture classification system based on a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. This system utilizes 3-D point-cloud data captured using Texas Instrument’s IWR1843BOOST frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar module to classify the posture of the subject. Two types of datasets are extracted from these radar data: 1) image dataset derived from the isometric view of the point-cloud data and 2) spatial coordinates dataset also extracted from the point-cloud data. A low-computational tiny machine learning (TinyML) model is employed on the datasets for efficient implementation on embedded hardware, Raspberry Pi 3 B+. The proposed model’s parameters were quantized to 8 bits (int8), which accurately classify four postures, i.e., standing, sitting, lying, and bending, with an accuracy of 98.97% for the image data. However, to make it more computationally efficient, the int8 quantized TinyML model was trained on the spatial coordinates dataset, giving an accuracy of 96.12%. This highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed lightweight model that can be deployed on edge devices for real-world applications.},

Our designed sensor can remotely monitor BP, HR, and SpO2. Our device collects, evaluates, predicts, and reads health data and then stores it on a remote platform named “ThinkSpeak,” which forms an IoT platform, with a 0.91 organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) screen display for viewing numerical health readings locally. We used a biomedical sensor device with an embedded signal condition unit, and a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal was employed to derive and measure the PPG signal. A computer-based algorithm was generated, which factored in selected beneficial parameters measured from a single bio-inspired PPG signal. The measured PPG signal was used to estimate the individual user’s BP (both systolic and diastolic values), HR, and SpO2. An automatic multiscale-based peak (AMBP) detection algorithm was developed to obtain the maximum peak of the PPG signal. Furthermore, the developed sensor was benchmarked against two standard commercially available measurement devices: a Contec ambulatory BP sensor and a Braun pulse oximeter monitor. Our developed sensor is worn as a ring sensor and is interfaced with an Arduino 1010 WIFI MKR for remote health monitoring. Our estimated BP, HR, and SpO2 values were remotely monitored and a graphical representation was constructed.},

  abstract={Medical sensors and distributed edge networks hold promise in advanced control and prediction of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Their integration can lower communication latency, bandwidth utilization, and energy consumption while achieving high application scalability and reliability. Existing edge-devices-enabled e-healthcare frameworks face two serious challenges that affect their success. First, real-time medical sensors generate similar or redundant readings used for disease prediction, mostly for non-COVID-19 patients, which increases data transmission latency and energy consumption. Second, predicting the risk level of COVID-19 patients using lightweight machine learning requires minimal training time to be useful. To address these challenges, we develop an edge-centric e-healthcare framework for online health data monitoring and analysis to predict the risk level of COVID-19 patients. In the proposed framework, a statistical data aggregation method (MEAN function) is deployed at local gateway devices to remove redundant data to minimize communication latency and energy usage. Geo-distributed edge servers are used to predict with 97 percent accuracy the risk level to each patient with Random Forest (RF) on the aggregated data. Finally, the efficiency of the RF algorithm is demonstrated with standard classification techniques.},

  year={2024},
  volume={21},
  number={1},
  pages={428-441},
  abstract={Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient’s smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners—Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.},

  abstract={The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as `MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables.},

  abstract={Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.},

  abstract={Ballistocardiography (BCG) is a vibration signal of human cardiac activity, which can be obtained by an optical fiber sensor (OFS) in a noninvasive way. The proposed OFS, as a low power consumption, noncontact, noninvasive real-time health monitoring instrument, has been developed into an effective health care monitoring method. However, when people need to monitor BCG for a long time, a large number of BCG data needs to be collected, which is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, in this article, we proposed a novel deep learning model, termed BCGNET. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the short-term dependence between multivariate loads. Then, the recurrent neural network (RNN) model is used to capture the long-term dependence of load sequence, and the ultra-long-term repetitive pattern of load sequence is fully studied by using the long-short term memory (LSTM) network with a recurrent skip. Finally, the autoregressive layer and full connection layer are used for combined prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BCGNET; the accuracy is 91.43% achieved by the proposed BCGNET compared with CNN (89.61%), RNN (89.88%) and multihead attention network (MHA-Net) (90.22%), and also show the proposed model has good performance in BCG prediction and assessment.},

  abstract={The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.},

  abstract={In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were required to manually input their daily oxygen saturation (SpO2) and pulse rate (PR) values into a health monitoring system—unfortunately, such a process trend to be an error in typing. Several studies attempted to detect the physiological value from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR). However, the technology has limited availability with high cost. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel framework called pandemic accelerated human-machine collaboration (PACMAN) with a low-resource deep learning-based computer vision. We compared state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (scaled YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOR), including the commercial OCR tools for digit recognition on the captured images from the pulse oximeter display. All images were derived from crowdsourced data collection with varying quality and alignment. YOLOv5 was the best performing model against the given model comparison across all data sets, notably the correctly orientated image data set. We further improved the model performance with the digits auto-orientation algorithm and applied a clustering algorithm to extract SpO2 and PR values. The accuracy performance of YOLOv5 with the implementations was approximately 81.0–89.5%, which was enhanced compared to without any additional implementation. Accordingly, this study highlighted the completion of the PACMAN framework to detect and read digits in real-world data sets. The proposed framework has been currently integrated into the patient monitoring system utilized by hospitals nationwide.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely introduced to the existing medical system. An eHealth system based on IoT devices has gained widespread popularity. In this article, we propose an IoT eHealth framework to provide an autonomous solution for patients with interventional cardiovascular diseases. In this framework, wearable sensors are used to collect a patient's health data, which is daily monitored by a remote doctor. When the monitoring data is abnormal, the remote doctor will ask for image acquisition of the patient's cardiovascular internal conditions. We leverage edge computing to classify these training images by the local base classifier; thereafter, pseudo-labels are generated according to its output. Moreover, a deep segmentation network is leveraged for the segmentation of stent structs in intravascular optical coherence tomography and intravenous ultrasound images of patients. The experimental results demonstrate that remote and local doctors perform real-time visual communication to complete telesurgery. In the experiments, we adopt the U-net backbone with a pretrained SeResNet34 as the encoder to segment the stent structs. Meanwhile, a series of comparative experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method based on accuracy, sensitivity, Jaccard, and dice.},

  abstract={Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.},

  abstract={With the dramatic increase of the Internet of Medical Things devices, self and remote health data monitoring is consistently receiving more attention. However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party. The results of several stress tests conducted on a real case study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed solution, which shows good scalability and a modest impact on the application performance measured during the decentralized data access.},

  abstract={In social IoMT systems, resource-constrained devices face the challenges of limited computation, bandwidth, and privacy in the deployment of deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.},

  abstract={Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.},

  number={2},
  pages={1459-1469},
  abstract={Owing to increasing connected medical devices and rapid development of deep learning technologies, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has attracted great attention for healthcare monitoring with intelligent sensors. Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human’s vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human’s physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human’s vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT. The FedRadar codes and constructed radar datasets are available on https://github.com/bupt-uwb/FedRadar.},

  title={From Scalp to Ear-EEG: A Generalizable Transfer Learning Model for Automatic Sleep Scoring in Older People}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={448-456},
  abstract={Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.},

  pages={33-47},
  abstract={The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the “UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,” a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems.},

  pages={13327-13337},
  abstract={The need to improve smart health systems to monitor the health situation of patients has grown as a result of the spread of epidemic diseases, the ageing of the population, the increase in the number of patients, and the lack of facilities to treat them. This led to an increased demand for remote healthcare systems using biosensors. These biosensors produce a large volume of sensed data that will be received by the edge of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to be forwarded to the data centers of the cloud for further treatment. An edge-fog computing-enabled lossless electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression with epileptic seizure detection in IoMT networks is proposed in this article. The proposed approach achieves three functionalities. First, it reduces the amount of sent data from the edge to the fog gateway using lossless EEG data compression based on a hybrid approach of  $k$ -means clustering and Huffman encoding (KCHE) at the edge gateway. Second, it decides the epileptic seizure situation of the patient at the fog gateway based on the epileptic seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm. Third, it reduces the size of IoMT EEG data delivered to the cloud using the same lossless compression algorithm in the first step. Various measures implemented to show the effectiveness of the suggested approach and the comparison results confirm that the KCHE reduces the amount of EEG data transmitted to the fog and cloud platform and produces a suitable detection of an epileptic seizure. The average of compression power of the proposed KCHE is four times the average of compression power of other methods for all EEG records ( $Z, F, N, O$ , and  $S$ ). Furthermore, the proposed ESDNB outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy, where it provides accuracy from 99.53 % up to 99.99 % using the data set of Bonn University.},

Adding calcium carbonate resulted in a microstructure of graphite that decreased the electrical sheet resistance and resistance to 11.61 Ω/◻ and 0.127 Ω. The signal-to-noise ratio of the electrocardiogram (ECG) was 31.02 dB with built-in front-end powering noise filtration. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was achieved by bio-impedance measurement and showed outstanding systolic and diastolic pressure values with a correlation coefficient of 0.799, and exhibited a similar interval time to define the same precise heart rate. The ECG data from the prepared electrode were applied to the machine learning models. The Random Forest (RF) model exhibited the optimized prediction value, with an F1 score of 99.9%. Equipment made from carbon screen-printing inks showed potential for health care monitoring with no excessive pressure, dry processing, and repeatability as a flexible wearable bio-electronic device.},

  abstract={Recent trends have shown a widespread increase in the landscape of digital healthcare (i.e., Healthcare 4.0) services, such as personalized healthcare, intelligent rehabilitation, telemedicine, and smart diet management, among others. These healthcare services are based on a variety of diverse requirements. Fulfilling these requirements require proactive intelligent analytics and self-sustainability of networks. Self-sustainability enables the operation of a network with minimum possible interaction from the end-users/network operators, whereas proactive intelligent analytics enables efficient management of resources in response to users’ requests. To enable healthcare 4.0 with proactive online analytics and self-sustainability, one can leverage digital twins. In this article, we present an overview and recent advances of digital twins for healthcare 4.0. An architecture of digital twins for healthcare is also proposed. Furthermore, we present several use cases of digital twins. Finally, we present open research challenges with possible solutions.},

  abstract={Internet of things (IoT) and machine learning based systems incorporating smart wearable technology are rapidly evolving to monitor and manage healthcare and physical activities. This paper is focused on the proposition of a fog-centric wireless, real-time, smart wearable and IoT-based framework for ubiquitous health and fitness analysis in a smart gym environment. The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data. The purpose of the GAR module is to collect and analyze exercise specific data. The GAR module achieved an accuracy of above 89% on athlete independent model based on muscle group.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been widely adopted across various industries for remote decision-making, monitoring, and surveillance. The proliferation of IoT applications in sensitive sectors, such as national defense and security, has been driven by the ability to obtain in-depth information on ubiquitous occurrences. Conspicuously, the current research presents a comprehensive framework based on the IoT-empowered Digital Twin technology for assessing the national integrity of defense personnel. The primary objective is to identify the integral behavior of military personnel by securely tracking everyday activities. The proposed method demonstrated the ability to accurately analyze an individual’s anomalous occurrences in activities using a hybrid Convolution Neural Network with Gated Recurrent Units. Moreover, each personnel is mapped using a secure blockchain platform for acquiring social interactions and activities to identify potential threats to national security. The proposed model has been validated using challenging date sets obtained from public repositories. The computed results indicate that the proposed solution is successful in facilitating the development of high-quality defense services. The effectiveness of the suggested solution is evaluated using statistical metrics including vulnerable activity recognition (Precision 95.24%), model training and testing (Precision 95.24%, Recall (95.00%), and F-Measure 94.11%), latency rate (7.45 seconds), and data processing cost( $\theta $ ((n-1) logn)).},

  title={Assessing Free-Living Postural Sway in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={32},

  pages={967-973},
  abstract={Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.},

  year={2023},

  number={13},
  pages={14997-15009},
  abstract={Falling is one of the primary causes of firefighter casualties. Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters’ data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system’s heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification. This study enhances the practicability of PIFDS and extends the application range of PIFDS from healthcare to firefighting.},

  abstract={Stoke is a leading cause of long-term disability, including upper-limb hemiparesis. Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with $R^{2}=0.72$. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.},

  year={2024},

  pages={1-10},
  abstract={In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2%, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.},

  abstract={The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has escalated the information sharing among various smart devices by many folds, irrespective of their geographical locations. Recently, applications like e-healthcare monitoring has attracted wide attention from the research community, where both the security and the effectiveness of the system are greatly imperative. However, to the best of our knowledge none of the existing literature can accomplish both these objectives (e.g., existing systems are not secure against physical attacks). This paper addresses the shortcomings in existing IoT-based healthcare system. We propose an enhanced system by introducing a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication scheme and a data driven fault-tolerant decision-making scheme for designing an IoT-based modern healthcare system. Analyses show that our proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than existing systems. Hence, it will be useful in designing an advanced IoT-based healthcare system.},

  year={2021},

  abstract={Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.},

  abstract={Confronted with the COVID-19 health crisis, the year 2020 represented a turning point for the entire world. It paved the way for health-care systems to reaffirm their foundations by using different technologies such as sensors, wearables, mobile applications, drones, robots, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). A lot of domains have been renovated such as diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, as well as previously unprecedented domains such as contact tracing. Contact tracing, in conjunction with the emergence, spread, and public compliance for vaccines, was a critical step for controlling and limiting the spread of the pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is usually dependent on individuals ability to recall their interactions, which is challenging and yet not effective. Consequently, further development and usage of automated, privacy-preserving, digital contact-tracing was required. As the pandemic is coming to an end, it is vital to collect and learn the effective used technologies that aided in fighting the virus in order to be prepared for any future pandemics and to be aware of any literature gaps that must be filled. This paper surveys state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, and applications combating COVID-19 at each phase of the five basic contact tracing phases, including case identification, contacts identification and rapid exposure notification, surveillance, regular follow up and prevention. In addition, there is a phase of preparation and post-pandemic services for current and needed future technology that will aid in the fight against any incoming infectious diseases.},

  abstract={A dual-channel single-mode-multi-mode-single-mode (SMS) fiber optic sensor encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was proposed for the first time, for the simultaneous monitoring of the brachial and radial arteries for accurate blood pressure prediction. With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate. The blood pressure monitoring system has the characteristics of low cost, high sensitivity, non-invasive and capability for remote real time monitoring, which can provide effective solution for intelligent health monitoring in the era of artificial intelligence in the future.},
