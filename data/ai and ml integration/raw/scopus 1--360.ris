AB  - The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) brings sweeping changes in various industries. Healthcare industries have become a prime example where the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) is making significant progress, particularly in how we approach real-time patient care. Traditional systems for monitoring older people and people with special needs are frequently expensive, require a large workforce, and fall short of providing real-time data. This paper introduces the '3-Tier Health Care Architecture,' an integrated approach to mitigating these issues. This architecture capitalizes on IoHT technologies and is constructed around three principal tiers: Sensor, Fog, and Cloud. The Sensor Tier employs Health Metrics Acquisition Units (HMAUs) fitted with an nRF5340 Development Kit, capturing an extensive range of health-related metrics via wearable sensors. These metrics are then relayed to the Local Processing Units (LPUs) in Fog Tier, which operates on Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W microprocessors for the initial data processing before forwarding to the cloud. The Cloud Tier uses a hybrid CNN-LSTM Machine Learning (ML) model to perform Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring (RTHM) status assessments and includes an Early Warning System for immediate alert issuance. The proposed architecture is resilient, scalable, and efficient, serving as a fortified and all-encompassing solution for RTHM. This enables quick medical interventions, thus elevating healthcare quality and potentially life-saving. © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human mesh reconstruction is essential for various applications, including virtual reality, motion capture, sports performance analysis, and healthcare monitoring. In healthcare contexts such as nursing homes, it is crucial to employ plausible and non-invasive methods for human mesh reconstruction that preserve privacy and dignity. Traditional vision-based techniques encounter challenges related to occlusion, viewpoint limitations, lighting conditions, and privacy concerns. In this research, we present CAvatar, a real-time human mesh reconstruction approach that innovatively utilizes pressure maps recorded by a tactile carpet as input. This advanced, non-intrusive technology obviates the need for cameras during usage, thereby safeguarding privacy. Our approach addresses several challenges, such as the limited spatial resolution of tactile sensors, extracting meaningful information from noisy pressure maps, and accommodating user variations and multiple users. We have developed an attention-based deep learning network, complemented by a discriminator network, to predict 3D human pose and shape from 2D pressure maps with notable accuracy. Our model demonstrates promising results, with a mean per joint position error (MPJPE) of 5.89 cm and a per vertex error (PVE) of 6.88 cm. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to generate 3D mesh of human activities solely using tactile carpet signals, offering a novel approach that addresses privacy concerns and surpasses the limitations of existing vision-based and wearable solutions.

AB  - The problem addressed in this research is a timely one in modern healthcare: the establishment of advanced health monitoring systems that are capable of drawing intelligent inferences and predictions in real time. By bringing together Internet of Things (IoT) technology and Deep Learning techniques, this research proposes a new approach to the realization of remote patient monitoring (RPM). This system is capable of achieving pervasiveness with today’s vital signs — such as blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation level and cerebral blood flow data — and can provide fall detection using radar sensors, as well as air pollution analysis in indoor environments, thus making the system augmentative and pervasive, not just comprehensive. The research demonstrates the highest accuracy in health anomaly detection and health risk stratification when utilizing Advanced Convolutional Neural Networks for Health Anomaly Detection (ACN-HAD) which are developed and Health Risk Stratification Neural Networks (HRS-NN) to realize the potential for both personalized healthcare and predictive analysis, thus advancing the state of the art in smart healthcare technologies. The results presented have significant potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery and its efficiencies, with the prospect for better patient outcomes. © Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most unremitting and dynamic neurodegenerative human diseases. Various wearable IoT devices have emerged for detecting, diagnosing, and quantifying PD, predominantly utilizing inertial sensors and computational algorithms. However, their proliferation poses novel challenges concerning security, privacy, connectivity, and power optimization. Clinically, continuous monitoring of patients’ motor function is imperative for optimizing Levodopa (L-dopa) dosage while mitigating adverse effects and motor activity decline. Tracking motor function alterations between visits is challenging, risking erroneous clinical decisions. Thus, there is a pressing need to furnish medical professionals with an ecosystem facilitating comprehensive Parkinson’s stage evaluation and disease progression monitoring, particularly regarding tremor and bradykinesia. This study endeavors to establish a holistic ecosystem centered around an energy-efficient Wi-Fi-enabled wearable bracelet dubbed A-WEAR. A-WEAR functions as a data collection conduit for Parkinson’s-related motion data, securely transmitting them to the Cloud for storage, processing, and severity estimation via bespoke learning algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate the resilience and effectiveness of the suggested technique, with 86.4% accuracy for bradykinesia and 90.9% accuracy for tremor estimation, along with good sensitivity and specificity for each scoring class. The recommended approach will support the timely determination of the severity of PD and ongoing patient activity monitoring. The system helps medical practitioners in decision making when initially assessing patients with PD and reviewing their progress and the effects of any treatment. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Motor symptoms such as tremor and bradykinesia can develop concurrently in Parkinson's disease; thus, the ideal home monitoring system should be capable of tracking symptoms continuously despite background noise from daily activities. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of detecting symptom episodes in a free-living scenario, providing a higher level of interpretability to aid AI-powered decision-making. Machine learning models trained on wearable sensor data from scripted activities performed by participants in the lab and clinician ratings of the video recordings of these tasks identified tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in the supervised lab environment with a balanced accuracy of 83%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, when compared to the clinician ratings. The performance of the same models when evaluated on data from subjects performing unscripted activities unsupervised in their own homes achieved a balanced accuracy of 63%, 63%, and 67%, respectively, in comparison to self-assessment patient diaries, further highlighting their limitations. The ankle-worn sensor was found to be advantageous for the detection of dyskinesias but did not show an added benefit for tremor and bradykinesia detection here. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This article introduces an advanced vital sign monitoring system that seamlessly integrates sensor technology, wireless communication, and machine learning (ML) algorithms to enhance patient care. The system accurately records and interprets vital physiological metrics such as oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate (HR), and body temperature. The integration forms the foundation of our comprehensive approach to patient health status classification through the ML algorithm. We employed three distinct ML algorithms - K-nearest neighbors (KNNs), support vector machines (SVMs), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) models to analyze health states, each precisely trained and validated using data collected from sensors on vital sign. This meticulous training aims to enable the models to accurately identify various patient health states, with the KNN model achieving an average accuracy of 92%, while the SVM and SGD models attained even higher accuracies of 94% and 97%, respectively. These outcomes were rigorously validated against established health scoring systems, showcasing the models' exceptional performance in multiclass classification scenarios. This is further evidenced by their area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) scores: KNN (0.9021), SVM (0.9841), and SGD (0.9933). The integration of these technologies into our health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in the continuous and comprehensive assessment of patient health, demonstrating the potential of modern technologies to revolutionize healthcare monitoring and management. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The growing elderly population in smart home environments necessitates increased remote medical support and frequent doctor visits. To address this need, wearable sensor technology plays a crucial role in designing effective healthcare systems for the elderly, facilitating human–machine interaction. However, wearable technology has not been implemented accurately in monitoring various vital healthcare parameters of elders because of inaccurate monitoring. In addition, healthcare providers encounter issues regarding the acceptability of healthcare parameter monitoring and secure data communication within the context of elderly care in smart home environments. Therefore, this research is dedicated to investigating the accuracy of wearable sensors in monitoring healthcare parameters and ensuring secure data transmission. An architectural framework is introduced, outlining the critical components of a comprehensive system, including Sensing, Data storage, and Data communication (SDD) for the monitoring process. These vital components highlight the system's functionality and introduce elements for monitoring and tracking various healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. The collected data is subsequently communicated to healthcare providers to enhance the well-being of elderly individuals. The SDD taxonomy guides the implementation of wearable sensor technology through environmental and body sensors. The proposed system demonstrates the accuracy enhancement of healthcare parameter monitoring and tracking through smart sensors. This study evaluates state-of-the-art articles on monitoring and tracking healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of delineating the SSD taxonomy by classifying the system's major components, contributing to the analysis and resolution of existing challenges. It emphasizes the efficiency of remote monitoring techniques in enhancing healthcare services for the elderly in smart home environments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Soft and stretchable electronics have garnered significant attention in various fields, such as wearable electronics, electronic skins, and soft robotics. However, current wearable electronics made from materials like conductive elastomers, hydrogels, and liquid metals face limitations, including low permeability, poor adhesion, inadequate conductivity, and limited stretchability. These issues hinder their effectiveness in long-term healthcare monitoring and exercise monitoring. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel design of web-droplet-like electronics featuring a semi-liquid metal coating for wearable applications. This innovative design offers high permeability, excellent stretchability, strong adhesion, and good conductivity for the electronic skin. The unique structure, inspired by the architecture of a spider web, significantly enhances air permeability compared to commercial breathable patches. Furthermore, the distribution of polyborosiloxane mimics the adhesive properties of spider web mucus, while the use of semi-liquid metals in this design results in remarkable conductivity (9 × 106 S/m) and tensile performance (up to 850% strain). This advanced electronic skin technology enables long-term monitoring of various physiological parameters and supports machine learning recognition functions with unparalleled advantages. This web-droplet structure design strategy holds great promise for commercial applications in medical health monitoring and disease diagnosis. © 2024 Science China Press

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by automating the detection and classification of events and anomalies. In the scope of this work, events and anomalies are abnormalities in the patient's data, where the former are due to a medical condition, such as a seizure or a fall, and the latter are erroneous data due to faults or malicious attacks. AI-based event and anomaly detection (EAD) and their classification can improve patient outcomes by identifying problems earlier, enabling more timely interventions while minimizing false alarms caused by anomalies. Moreover, the advancement of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT), or wearable devices, and their high processing capabilities facilitated the gathering, AI-based processing, and transmission of data, which enabled remote patient monitoring, and personalized and predictive healthcare. However, it is fundamental in healthcare to ensure the explainability of AI systems, meaning that they can provide understandable and transparent reasoning for their decisions. This article proposes an online EAD approach using a lightweight autoencoder (AE) on the MIoT. The detected abnormality is explained using KernelSHAP, an explainable AI (XAI) technique, where the explanation of the abnormality is used, by an artificial neural network (ANN), to classify it into an event or anomaly. Intensive simulations are conducted using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) data set for various physiological data. Results showed the robustness of the proposed approach in the detection and classification of events, regardless of the percentage of the present anomalies.  © 2014 IEEE.

The paucity of a competent and secure remote patient monitoring system and a lack of an appropriate platform to disseminate the information about the patient’s condition to the concerned relatives and doctors was felt during the recent pandemic. Moreover, during COVID-19, a sudden deterioration in the patient’s condition was observed in the hospital. Motivated by these issues, we have proposed a secure and robust decentralized patient monitoring model called CovMedCare for monitoring COVID-19 inpatients utilizing the confluence of Machine Learning, the Internet of Things and Blockchain technologies. In the proposed model, sensor data from WBAN is integrated with the patient’s previous health records to predict the patient’s deteriorating health condition over a blockchain network for timely decisions with minimum delay. The accuracy of the proposed model is assessed on a dataset with five medical sensor attributes and fifteen previous health records attributes collected from a hospital with 40,000 samples. The extensive experimental results exhibit that the proposed system performs better than the existing ones and achieves an accuracy of 99% in identifying the patient whose health condition is deteriorating. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The present article underscored the indispensable significance of end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) monitoring in anesthesia and critical care, offering critical insights into both ventilation and metabolism dynamics. The meticulous management of tidal volume, respiratory rate, and inspired oxygen levels during anesthesia plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. Effective ventilation is imperative for proper gas exchange within the alveoli and maintaining a stable acid-base balance. In the context of circulatory physiology during anesthesia, cardiac output, blood pressure, and tissue perfusion hold paramount importance. The present article highlights how anesthesia-induced alterations in vascular tone and cardiac function could influence circulation and tissue oxygenation, impacting parameters like blood pressure, heart rate, and ETCO2. Monitoring these parameters provides essential data for assessing circulatory status, guiding anesthesia management, and averting complications. ETCO2 monitoring has evolved into a standard practice in anesthesia and critical care settings, offering real-time, non-invasive insights. The present article delved into the extensive clinical applications, challenges, and future directions of ETCO2 monitoring. Encompassing fundamental principles, technological nuances, clinical implications, limitations, and avenues for research, this article advanced the understanding of this monitoring technique and its positive impact on patient care. The present article also discussed how ETCO2 levels reflect alveolar ventilation, providing critical data for assessing ventilation adequacy, readiness for extubation, and identification of impending respiratory distress. Furthermore, it delved into how ETCO2 levels serve as an indicator of cardiac output and tissue perfusion, guiding management strategies in various shock states and offering prognostic insights during CPR. Challenges and limitations associated with ETCO2 monitoring were clarified, with emphasis on technical considerations, patient populations with specific challenges, and potential interpretation pitfalls. The article outlines the exciting future directions of ETCO2 monitoring, encompassing wearable technology, remote monitoring capabilities, artificial intelligence integration, and potential applications beyond traditional realms. © 2024 Medical Association of Thailand.

AB  - This study presents a novel approach for affective computing through deep learning-assisted electroencephalography (EEG) analysis aimed at enhancing the detection, processing, interpretation, and emulation of human emotions. The proposed methodology introduces an Ear-EEG emotion recognition (EEER) system, leveraging a deep neural network and integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities. The key contributions of this study include 1) a comprehensive design framework encompassing both hardware and software aspects of the Ear-EEG system, as well as 2) a signals-to-three-channel image conversion method employing time-frequency super-resolution with superlets as inputs for deep learning models. Moreover 3) a modified vision transformer (ViT) architecture is introduced, incorporating shifted patch tokenization (SPT) and locality self-attention (LSA) techniques, addressing challenges associated with limited and imbalanced small datasets, as well as the lack of locality inductive bias for emotion recognition. Additionally, 4) an IoT-assisted EEER platform is proposed, enabling remote monitoring and management. Experimental results indicate that the trained ViT model with SPT and LSA surpasses recent models in terms of performance on untrained datasets, achieving an average accuracy of 92.39%. The findings highlight the efficacy of the proposed EEER system in accurately detecting emotional states, encompassing positive and negative affective states. The integration of artificial intelligence and IoT-based healthcare platforms represents a significant advancement in the development of medical assistant tools with broad implications for future applications. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The proportion of very old adults in the population is increasing, representing a significant challenge. Due to their vulnerability, there is a higher frequency of unplanned hospitalizations in this population, leading to adverse events. Digital tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) can help to identify early signs of vulnerability and unfavorable health events and can contribute to earlier and optimized management. Objective: This study aims to report the implementation in assisted living facilities of an innovative monitoring system (Presage Care) for predicting the short-term risk of emergency hospitalization. We describe its use and assess its performance. Methods: An uncontrolled multicenter intervention study was conducted between March and August 2022 in 7 assisted living facilities in France that house very old and vulnerable adults. The monitoring system was set up to provide alerts in cases of a high risk of emergency hospitalization. Nurse assistants (NAs) at the assisted living facilities used a smartphone app to complete a questionnaire on the functional status of the patients, comprising electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs); these were analyzed in real time by a previously designed machine learning algorithm. This remote monitoring of patients using ePROMs allowed notification of a coordinating nurse or a coordinating NA who subsequently informed the patient’s nurses or physician. The primary outcomes were the acceptability and feasibility of the monitoring system in the context and confirmation of the effectiveness and efficiency of AI in risk prevention and detection in practical, real-life scenarios. The secondary outcome was the hospitalization rate after alert-triggered interventions.Results: In this study, 118 of 194 (61%) eligible patients were included who had at least 1 follow-up visit. A total of 38 emergency hospitalizations were documented. The system generated 92 alerts for 47 of the 118 (40%) patients. Of these 92 alerts, 46 (50%) led to 46 health care interventions for 14 of the 118 (12%) patients and resulted in 4 hospitalizations. The other 46 of the 92 (50%) alerts did not trigger a health care intervention and resulted in 25 hospitalizations (P<.001). Almost all hospitalizations were associated with a lack of alert-triggered interventions (P<.001). System performance to predict hospitalization had a high specificity (96%) and negative predictive value (99.4%).Conclusions: The Presage Care system has been implemented with success in assisted living facilities. It was well accepted by coordinating nurses and performed well in predicting emergency hospitalizations. However, its use by NAs was less than expected. Overall, the system performed well in terms of performance and clinical impact in this setting. Nevertheless, further work is needed to improve the moderate use rate by NAs. ©Jacques-Henri Veyron, François Deparis, Marie Noel Al Zayat, Joël Belmin, Charlotte Havreng-Théry.

AB  - Continuous and reliable monitoring of gait is crucial for health monitoring, such as postoperative recovery of bone joint surgery and early diagnosis of disease. However, existing gait analysis systems often suffer from large volumes and the requirement of special space for setting motion capture systems, limiting their application in daily life. Here, we develop an intelligent gait monitoring and analysis prediction system based on flexible piezoelectric sensors and deep learning neural networks with high sensitivity (241.29 mV/N), quick response (66 ms loading, 87 ms recovery), and excellent stability (R2 = 0.9946). The theoretical simulations and experiments confirm that the sensor provides exceptional signal feedback, which can easily acquire accurate gait data when fitted to shoe soles. By integrating high-quality gait data with a custom-built deep learning model, the system can detect and infer human motion states in real time (the recognition accuracy reaches 94.7%). To further validate the sensor’s application in real life, we constructed a flexible wearable recognition system with human-computer interaction interface and a simple operation process for long-term and continuous tracking of athletes’ gait, potentially aiding personalized health management, early detection of disease, and remote medical care. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Prevalence estimates of Parkinson’s disease (PD)—the fastest-growing neurodegenerative disease—are generally underestimated due to issues surrounding diagnostic accuracy, symptomatic undiagnosed cases, suboptimal prodromal monitoring, and limited screening access. Remotely monitored wearable devices and sensors provide precise, objective, and frequent measures of motor and non-motor symptoms. Here, we used consumer-grade wearable device and sensor data from the WATCH-PD study to develop a PD screening tool aimed at eliminating the gap between patient symptoms and diagnosis. Early-stage PD patients (n = 82) and age-matched comparison participants (n = 50) completed a multidomain assessment battery during a one-year longitudinal multicenter study. Using disease- and behavior-relevant feature engineering and multivariate machine learning modeling of early-stage PD status, we developed a highly accurate (92.3%), sensitive (90.0%), and specific (100%) random forest classification model (AUC = 0.92) that performed well across environmental and platform contexts. These findings provide robust support for further exploration of consumer-grade wearable devices and sensors for global population-wide PD screening and surveillance. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Substance use disorders affect 17.3% of Americans. Digital health solutions that use machine learning to detect substance use from wearable biosignal data can eventually pave the way for real-time digital interventions. However, difficulties in addressing severe between-subject data heterogeneity have hampered the adaptation of machine learning approaches for substance use detection, necessitating more robust technological solutions. We tested the utility of personalized machine learning using participant-specific convolutional neural networks (CNNs) enhanced with self-supervised learning (SSL) to detect drug use. In a pilot feasibility study, we collected data from 9 participants using Fitbit Charge 5 devices, supplemented by ecological momentary assessments to collect real-time labels of substance use. We implemented a baseline 1D-CNN model with traditional supervised learning and an experimental SSL-enhanced model to improve individualized feature extraction under limited label conditions. Results: Among the 9 participants, we achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score across participants of 0.695 for the supervised CNNs and 0.729 for the SSL models. Strategic selection of an optimal threshold enabled us to optimize either sensitivity or specificity while maintaining reasonable performance for the other metric. Conclusion: These findings suggest that Fitbit data have the potential to enhance substance use monitoring systems. However, the small sample size in this study limits its generalizability to diverse populations, so we call for future research that explores SSL-powered personalization at a larger scale. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Noncommunicable diseases (NCD), such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, are defining healthcare challenges of the 21st century. Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women—a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States—using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Stoke is a leading cause of long-term disability, including upper-limb hemiparesis. Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories. We therefore propose and validate a two-phase data analytic pipeline to estimate upper-limb impairment based on the naturalistic performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with R2=0.72. These promising results support the potential to develop seamless, ecologically valid measures of real-world motor performance.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Wearable devices and deep learning methods for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) have attracted a lot of interest because they could change healthcare monitoring. This study presents a CNN-LSTM model to accurately and reliably detect human movements from smartphone sensor data. The proposed model takes advantage of both the strengths of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling time and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting features from space. This enables determining how the input data change over time and space. This study examines whether this method can work and is practical in real-life healthcare settings, focused on uses such as watching patients from distance, caring for the elderly, and therapy. The proposed model was evaluated on publicly accessible standard datasets. Various architectural configurations and hyperparameters were examined to determine their performance. The proposed CNN-LSTM model performed well and has great potential for practical use in activity tracking and environment understanding systems. © by the authors.

AB  - Background: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose Elderly people often face the risk of falls, which increases the need for walking aids to ensure mobility and safety. The occurrence of further injuries requires the use of additional orthopedic aids (e.g., foot orthoses). Wearing such an orthopedic aid also impairs the natural gait pattern, which leads to increased instability in older patients. This highlights the need for innovative solutions for assistive smart walking aids. Doan et al., for example, presented a smart walking aid for fall detection that can detect falls based on machine learning with an accuracy of 99.62% (Doan et al., 2024). This development can lead to improvements in home care and remote health monitoring technologies. However, a solution that allows the combined use of an intelligent walking aid with a smart foot orthosis to provide patients with active feedback does not exist. Based on the identified research gap, we propose the technical development of an augmented walking aid with haptic feedback that enables direct communication of sensor data with a smart foot orthosis. Providing additional feedback in case of problems with the foot orthosis is particularly important for patients with neuropathy in the feet (such as diabetic foot syndrome), for which neural feedback is not possible. Our approach enables direct haptic feedback through vibrations on the handle of the walking aid when acute problems are detected by the smart foot orthosis. The system achieves this by continuously monitoring relevant gait parameters and pressure distributions in the foot orthosis. This should support the proactive adaptation of gait problems and increase safety when using assistive technologies for older people. Method The concept development is based on a comprehensive literature analysis of existing walking aids, as well as the identification of patient needs for the use of augmented feedback and wearable technologies. Based on these findings, we have developed an initial concept for a feedback-enabled walking aid designed for combined use with a smart foot orthosis, which provides real-time feedback on the patient's gait behavior. Figure 1 shows the proposed conceptual design of the intelligent walking aid with an integrated vibration motor on the handle and an inertial measurement unit to determine the spatial parameters. Wireless communication of recorded data occurs via Bluetooth. Results and Discussion We propose to investigate the system in an experimental within-subject study to evaluate the effectiveness of gait improvement, as well as usability and social acceptance, with a sample size of 20 participants. In this context, we intend to use the think-aloud protocol to gain deeper insights into the participants’ thought processes during interaction with the system. By combining the proposed concept with a smart foot wearable device that provides specific data on foot positioning and movement, we expect a more reliable gait analysis and better tailored corrective suggestions. Additionally, the application of machine learning allows the identification of gait patterns and the initiation of preventive measures against potential fall risks. In future applications, the system can be modularly expanded to include additional walking aids, such as walking sticks, crutches, or walkers. © (2024), (International Society for Gerontechnology).

AB  - Flexible and stretchable strain sensors have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in various fields including human health monitoring and human-machine interfaces. Previous studies have shown that strain sensors based on microcracks can exhibit both high sensitivity and a wide sensing range by manipulating the opening and closing of randomly generated cracks within conductive thin films. However, the uncontrolled nature of microcrack formation can cause a drift in the sensor's performance over time, affecting its accuracy and reliability. In this study, by pre-defining the cracks, we introduce a novel resistive strain sensor with high sensitivity, excellent linearity, an ultra-low detection limit, and robustness against off-axis deformation. The sensor operates on a simple mechanism involving the modulation of ohmic contact within intricately designed conductive serpentine curves, which are encapsulated by pre-stretched thin films. This design facilitates a high gauge factor of 495, exceptional linearity (R2 > 0.98), and an ultra-low detection threshold of 0.01% strain. Moreover, it maintains performance integrity during off-axis deformations such as bending and twisting, features that are indispensable for accurately monitoring human motion. To explore practical applications, a driving scenario was simulated where a sensor array was positioned on the driver's neck. The sensor output was analyzed using machine learning algorithms to successfully determine the presence of driver fatigue. This demonstration underlines the potential of our sensor technology in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to wearable biomechanical systems and human-machine interfaces. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) often present lower extremity motor dysfunction. However, traditional radiography is a static assessment and cannot achieve long-term dynamic functional monitoring. Plantar pressure signals have demonstrated potential applications in the diagnosis and rehabilitation monitoring of KOA. Objective: Through wearable gait analysis technology, we aim to obtain abundant gait information based on machine learning techniques to develop a simple, rapid, effective, and patient-friendly functional assessment model for the KOA rehabilitation process to provide long-term remote monitoring, which is conducive to reducing the burden of social health care system. Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients diagnosed with KOA who were able to walk independently for 2 minutes. Participants were given clinically recommended functional tests, including the 40-m fast-paced walk test (40mFPWT) and timed up-and-go test (TUGT). We used a smart shoe system to gather gait pressure data from patients with KOA. The multidimensional gait features extracted from the data and physical characteristics were used to establish the KOA functional feature database for the plantar pressure measurement system. 40mFPWT and TUGT regression prediction models were trained using a series of mature machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, model stacking and average ensemble learning methods were adopted to further improve the generalization performance of the model. Mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used as regression performance metrics to evaluate the results of different models. Results: A total of 92 patients with KOA were included, exhibiting varying degrees of severity as evaluated by the Kellgren and Lawrence classification. A total of 380 gait features and 4 physical characteristics were extracted to form the feature database. Effective stepwise feature selection determined optimal feature subsets of 11 variables for the 40mFPWT and 10 variables for the TUGT. Among all models, the weighted average ensemble model using 4 tree-based models had the best generalization performance in the test set, with an MAE of 2.686 seconds, MAPE of 9.602%, and RMSE of 3.316 seconds for the prediction of the 40mFPWT and an MAE of 1.280 seconds, MAPE of 12.389%, and RMSE of 1.905 seconds for the prediction of the TUGT. Conclusions: This wearable plantar pressure feature technique can objectively quantify indicators that reflect functional status and is promising as a new tool for long-term remote functional monitoring of patients with KOA. Future work is needed to further explore and investigate the relationship between gait characteristics and functional status with more functional tests and in larger sample cohorts. ©Junan Xie, Shilin Li, Zhen Song, Lin Shu, Qing Zeng, Guozhi Huang, Yihuan Lin.

AB  - Background: Hyperkalemia, characterized by elevated serum potassium levels, heightens the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly increasing risk for individuals with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Traditional laboratory test monitoring is resource-heavy, invasive, and unable to provide continuous tracking. Wearable technologies like smartwatches with electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities are emerging as valuable tools for remote monitoring, potentially allowing for personalized monitoring with artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG interpretation. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop an AI-ECG algorithm to predict serum potassium level in ESRD patients with smartwatch-generated ECG waveforms. Methods: A cohort of 152,508 patients with 293,557 ECGs paired serum potassium levels obtained within 1 hour at Cedars Sinai Medical Center was used to train an AI-ECG model (“Kardio-Net”) to predict serum potassium level. The model was further fine-tuned on 4,337 ECGs from 1,463 patients with ESRD using inputs from 12- and single-lead ECGs. Kardio-Net was evaluated in held-out test cohorts from Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Stanford Healthcare (SHC) as well as a prospective international cohort of 40 ESRD patients with smartwatch ECGs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Results: The Kardio-Net, when applied to 12-lead ECGs, identified severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) with an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.745-0.956) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.527 mEq/L. In external validation at SHC, the model achieved an AUC of 0.849 (95% CI: 0.823-0.875) and an MAE of 0.599 mEq/L. For single-lead ECGs, Kardio-Net detected severe hyperkalemia with an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.765-0.987) in the primary cohort and had an MAE of 0.575 mEq/L. In the external SHC validation, the AUC was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.778-0.835) with an MAE of 0.740 mEq/L. Using prospectively obtained smartwatch data, the AUC was 0.831 (95% CI: 0.693-0.975), with an MAE of 0.580 mEq/L. Conclusions: We validate a deep learning model to predict serum potassium levels from both 12-lead ECGs and single-lead smartwatch data, demonstrating its utility for remote monitoring of hyperkalemia. © 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation

AB  - Breathable and stretchable conductive materials are ideal for healthcare wearable electronic devices. However, the tradeoff between the sensitivity and detection range of electronic sensors and the challenge posed by simple-functional electronics limits their development. Here, inspired by the bionic-leaf vein conductive path, silver nanowires (AgNWs)-Ti3C2Tx (MXene) hybrid structure assembled on the nonwoven fabrics (NWF) is well sandwiched between porous polyborosiloxane elastomer (PBSE) to construct the multifunctional breathable wearable electronics with both high anti-impact performance and good sensing behavior. Benefiting from the high conductive AgNWs-MXene hybrid structure, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity (GF = 1158.1), wide monitoring range (57 %), controllable thermal management properties, and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding effect (SET = 41.46 dB). Moreover, owing to the wonderful shear stiffening effect of PBSE, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE possesses a high energy absorption performance. Combining with deep learning, this breathable electronic device can be further applied to wireless sensing gloves and multifunctional medical belts, which will drive the development of electronic skin, human-machine interaction, and personalized healthcare monitoring applications. © 2024

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. COVID-19 become an active epidemic disease due to its spread around the globe. The main causes of the spread are through interaction and transmission of the droplets through coughing and sneezing. The spread can be minimized by isolating the susceptible patients. However, it necessitates remote monitoring to check the breathing issues of the patient remotely to minimize the interactions for spread minimization. Thus, in this article, we offer a wearable-IoTs-centered framework for remote monitoring and recognition of the breathing pattern and abnormal breath detection for timely providing the proper oxygen level required. We propose wearable sensors accelerometer and gyroscope-based breathing time-series data acquisition, temporal features extraction, and machine learning algorithms for pattern detection and abnormality identification. The sensors provide the data through Bluetooth and receive it at the server for further processing and recognition. We collect the six breathing patterns from the twenty subjects and each pattern is recorded for about five minutes. We match prediction accuracies of all machine learning models under study (i.e. Random forest, Gradient boosting tree, Decision tree, and K-nearest neighbor. Our results show that normal breathing and Bradypnea are the most correctly recognized breathing patterns. However, in some cases, algorithm recognizes kussmaul well also. Collectively, the classification outcomes of Random Forest and Gradient Boost Trees are better than the other two algorithms. © 2024 KSII.

AB  - The COVID-19 epidemic has raised awareness of exactly how crucial it is to continuously observe issues and diagnose respiratory problems early. Although the respiratory system is the primary objective of the disease’s acute phase, subsequent complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection might trigger enduring respiratory problems and symptoms, according to new research. These signs and symptoms, which collectively inflict considerable strain on healthcare systems and people’s quality of life, comprise, but are not restricted to, congestion, shortage of breath, tightness in the chest, and a decrease in lung function. Wearable technology offers a promising remedy to this persistent issue by offering continuous respiratory parameter monitoring, facilitating the early control and intervention of post-COVID-19 issues with respiration. In an effort to enhance patient outcomes and reduce expenses related to healthcare, this paper examines the possibility of using wearable technology to provide remote surveillance and the early diagnosis of respiratory problems in individuals suffering from COVID-19. In this work, a fog computing-based cost-effective smart health monitoring device is proposed for infectious disease applications. Further, the proposed device consists of three different biosensor modules, namely a MAX90614 infrared temperature sensor, a MAX30100 pulse oximeter, and a microphone sensor. All these sensor modules are connected to a fog computing device, namely a Raspberry PI microcontroller. Also, three different sensor modules were integrated with the Raspberry PI microcontroller and individuals’ physiological parameters, such as oxygen saturation (SPO2), heartbeat rate, and cough sounds, were recorded by the computing device. Additionally, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based deep learning algorithm was coded inside the Raspberry PI and was trained with normal and COVID-19 cough sounds from the KAGGLE database. This work appears to be of high clinical significance since the developed fog computing-based smart health monitoring device is capable of identifying the presence of infectious disease through individual physiological parameters. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Fatal coronary heart disease (FCHD) is often described as sudden cardiac death (affects >4 million people/year), where coronary artery disease is the only identified condition. Electrocardiographic artificial intelligence (ECG-AI) models for FCHD risk prediction using ECG data from wearable devices could enable wider screening/monitoring efforts. Objectives: To develop a single-lead ECG–based deep learning model for FCHD risk prediction and assess concordance between clinical and Apple Watch ECGs. Methods: An FCHD single-lead (“lead I” from 12-lead ECGs) ECG-AI model was developed using 167,662 ECGs (50,132 patients) from the University of Tennessee Health Sciences Center. Eighty percent of the data (5-fold cross-validation) was used for training and 20% as a holdout. Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models incorporating ECG-AI predictions with age, sex, and race were also developed. The models were tested on paired clinical single-lead and Apple Watch ECGs from 243 St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study participants. The correlation and concordance of the predictions were assessed using Pearson correlation (R), Spearman correlation (ρ), and Cohen's kappa. Results: The ECG-AI and CPH models resulted in AUC = 0.76 and 0.79, respectively, on the 20% holdout and AUC = 0.85 and 0.87 on the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist external validation data. There was moderate-strong positive correlation between predictions (R = 0.74, ρ = 0.67, and κ = 0.58) when tested on the 243 paired ECGs. The clinical (lead I) and Apple Watch predictions led to the same low/high-risk FCHD classification for 99% of the participants. CPH prediction correlation resulted in an R = 0.81, ρ = 0.76, and κ = 0.78. Conclusion: Risk of FCHD can be predicted from single-lead ECGs obtained from wearable devices and are statistically concordant with lead I of a 12-lead ECG. © 2024 Heart Rhythm Society

AB  - Background: The use of digital biomarkers through remote patient monitoring offers valuable and timely insights into a patient’s condition, including aspects such as disease progression and treatment response. This serves as a complementary resource to traditional health care settings leveraging mobile technology to improve scale and lower latency, cost, and burden. Objective: Smartphones with embedded and connected sensors have immense potential for improving health care through various apps and mobile health (mHealth) platforms. This capability could enable the development of reliable digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely from patients. Methods: We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support large-scale data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a modern remote data collection platform built around Confluent’s Apache Kafka to support scalability, extensibility, security, privacy, and quality of data. It provides support for study design and setup and active (eg, patient-reported outcome measures) and passive (eg, phone sensors, wearable devices, and Internet of Things) remote data collection capabilities with feature generation (eg, behavioral, environmental, and physiological markers). The back end enables secure data transmission and scalable solutions for data storage, management, and data access. Results: The platform has been used to successfully collect longitudinal data for various cohorts in a number of disease areas including multiple sclerosis, depression, epilepsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, autism, and lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases. Conclusions: RADAR-base offers a contemporary, open-source solution driven by the community for remotely monitoring, collecting data, and digitally characterizing both physical and mental health conditions. Clinicians have the ability to enhance their insight through the use of digital biomarkers, enabling improved prevention, personalization, and early intervention in the context of disease management. © Zulqarnain Rashid, Amos A Folarin, Yuezhou Zhang, Yatharth Ranjan, Pauline Conde, Heet Sankesara, Shaoxiong Sun, Callum Stewart, Petroula Laiou, Richard J B Dobson.

AB  - Background: The most recent exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD) classification criteria relies in part on changes in respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Despite this paradigm shift, a thorough understanding of exacerbation patterns is still lacking, as is the identification of physiological exacerbation biomarkers. Methods: Using a convenience sampling approach, this prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 2023 and January 2024. Continuous measurements of daytime/overnight respiratory (primary outcome), cardiovascular, autonomic, activity and sleep-related parameters were collected by a wearable biometric wristband and ring over 21 consecutive days in free-living outpatients experiencing and receiving treatment (≤3 days) for a current exacerbation from the home environment. The EXACT-PRO questionnaire served as the validated reference for daily symptom burden and to identify ‘recovered’ versus ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Unadjusted and adjusted (for age, sex, FEV1) linear mixed-effects models were fitted to estimate associations between each physiological parameter with daily EXACT-PRO score (points, pts), in all, ‘recovered’, and ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Results are presented as point estimates with 95% CIs. Findings: In 21 participants with COPD (43% female, mean age 66.8, BMI 27.7 kg/m2, FEV1 36.3% predicted; 85.7% with GOLD 3–4 disease), significant associations in unadjusted models with daily EXACT-PRO score included RR variability (−1.45 [−2.84, −0.073] pts/breath/min) but not RR, daily step count (−0.56 [−0.82, −0.31] pts/1000 steps), and sleep efficiency (−0.12 [−0.20, −0.037] pts/%asleep). In ‘recovered’ participants (n = 10), significant associations included nighttime HR, movement intensity and nightly SpO2. In ‘persistent worsening’ participants (n = 11), significant associations included HR variability, nightly RR variability, nightly SpO2, sleep efficiency, and skin temperature. Similar results were found in adjusted models. Interpretation: This study provides a prospective continuous characterisation of exacerbations of COPD using remotely collected, ambulatory/free-living data. The physiological patterns presented may contribute to the understanding of exacerbations and may enhance the development of effective remote monitoring solutions.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) involves the prediction of movement type of a human, based on raw data being captured from wearable sensors or vision based sensors. HAR systems have sapped great interest over the period of time due to its wide applications in the field of healthcare, surveillance and also in the coming generation of metaverse. This article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) based system using hybrid deep learning model to recognise various human activities from the video footages. The deep convolutional layers and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been combined to generate the hybrid deep learning model known as convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). The deep convolutional layers of deep convolutional neural network Inception V3 Net have been used to extract the feature values from the video frames corresponding to each human activity and each generated feature vector has been classified to the appropriate activity class by the gated recurrent unit (GRU) variant of RNN classifier. The performance of the proposed HAR system has been evaluated on the three widely used public datasets—KTH, UCF101, and UCF sports action dataset. GRU variant of RNN classifier is capable to store and remember a long temporal sequence of video frames, generating the pattern of any human activity, over a long duration and so experimental results exhibit that the proposed hybrid deep learning based HAR system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods available in this research domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Wireless, multimodal, wearable sensor patches can perform remote diagnosis and monitoring. By integrating multiple sensors, multimodal, wearable patches generate large datasets. Complex data correlation and analyses of large datasets for real-time, automatic edge-type systems are challenging. Here, we present an integrated wearable sensor patch with edge computing for remote healthcare applications powered by reservoir computing. This sensor patch system is integrated with flexible sensors for electrocardiography, respiration, skin temperature, and skin humidity. Vital and activity data can be applied to monitor coughing, arrhythmias, and posture using a machine learning algorithm. Importantly, all measurements, wireless data transmission, and real-time data analyses are processed in a smartphone as an edge-computing system, which allows quick, real-time feedback to users without using a cloud network system. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Flexible visual sensors hold great potential for application in wearable electronics and health monitoring. However, the separate acquisition of various visual signals without mutual interference and their functional integration in internal biomedical devices remains a significant challenge. Here, a functional material that integrates mechanoluminescent units with biosensing units through supramolecular interactions, enabling bimodal non-interfering visual detection of orthodontic force and bacterial infection is presented. The orthodontic force induces fluorescence by facilitating the release of electrons from trapped energy levels, caused by the disruption or rearrangement of defect structures within strontium aluminate crystals. Meanwhile, the seamlessly integrated biosensing component can effectively detect lactic acid in a dose-dependent manner, underscoring its multifunctional capabilities in biosensing applications. Moreover, the development of a cloud-based deep learning server can achieve a 97.7% accuracy in the precise decoupling of visual signals, facilitating remote monitoring and enabling early intervention during orthodontic treatment. The proposed artificial intelligence-enhanced bimodal visual sensors represent a new paradigm for orthodontic monitoring, suitable for a wide range of biomedical applications. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is becoming increasingly mainstream as their applications continue to grow. These applications include remote healthcare monitoring, drug storage, alarm systems, and medical wearable devices. Remote patient monitoring, especially using wearable devices, has improved the health and protection of numerous people, while avoiding unnecessary hospital visits. Ideally, healthcare monitoring systems should accurately and timely detect if the patient is entering a critical condition, and alert the concerned doctor accordingly. However, in practice, there are two kinds of alarms raised by such systems, namely, events and anomalies. Events are non-erroneous data that do not conform to the expected values, indicating abnormality in the patient's condition. On the other hand, anomalies are erroneous data that may result from faulty sensors, electromagnetic interference, malicious attacks, or hardware tampering. These anomalies lead to false alarms which affect the decision making process and may cause danger to the patient's life. Traditionally, wearable MIoTs, measuring different vitals, frequently communicate with the patient's phone, or a local processing unit (LPU), in order to analyze and process the collected data. However, the increase in processing capabilities of IoT devices has made on-device event detection possible. This adds an extra layer of defense while avoiding unnecessary communication with LPU. In this paper, a healthcare monitoring system is proposed which compromises of two layers - (1) an online lightweight approach, based on multivariate long-short term memory (LSTM) autoencoder, embedded in each MIoT, that is able to detect data abnormality and alarms the LPU, (2) a correlation technique, at the LPU, that differentiates between anomalies and events, and alerts the patient's doctor only in case of an event. Since a single sensor reading does not provide enough clinical insight to detect the full length of an event, a feature engineering approach is implemented to extract interpretable statistical, dynamic and physiological features that provide the clinical insight needed. The proposed approach is simulated using Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) dataset for various vital signs, such as heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. It is compared with four benchmarks, where the results show the robustness of the model in differentiating between anomalies and events, with event detection sensitivity and specificity above 93%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Healthcare providers face a significant challenge in the treatment of chronic pain, requiring creative responses to enhance patient outcomes and streamline healthcare delivery. It suggests using cloud-based remote management with machine learning (ML) to alleviate chronic pain. Wearable device data, electronic health record (EHR) data, and patient-reported outcomes are all inputs into the suggested system’s data analysis pipeline, which combines support vector machines (SVM) with recurrent neural networks (RNN). SVM’s powerful classification skills make it possible to classify patients’ risks and predict how they will react to therapy. RNNs are very good at processing sequential data, which means they may identify trends in patient symptoms and drug adherence over time. By integrating these algorithms, healthcare professionals may create individualized treatment programs that consider each patient’s preferences and specific requirements. Early intervention and proactive treatment of pain symptoms are made possible by the system’s ability to monitor patients in real-time remotely. The system is further improved by using predictive analytics to identify patients who could benefit from extra support services and to forecast when they will have acute pain episodes. The proposed approach can change the game regarding managing chronic pain. It provides data-driven, individualized treatment that improves patient outcomes while cutting healthcare expenses. © 2025 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia (PET) is a hypertensive disease that occurs during pregnancy or in the postpartum period. It complicates 2% to 8% of all pregnancies and is one of the causes of more than 50,000 maternal deaths and over 500,000 fetal deaths worldwide annually. Adverse birth outcomes due to pregnancy complications have been associated with three delays: delay in recognizing the complication, delay in reaching an appropriate facility, and delay in receiving adequate care when the facility is reached. Thus prevention, timely detection, and care of pregnancy complications can prevent maternal deaths and morbidity. The Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning (ML) technologies have become the new revolution of research in the field of healthcare. These technologies can be utilized to interconnect various sensors, monitor the health status of a patient, and predict the occurrence of an ailment. This study has designed and prototyped a pre-eclampsia monitoring model based on IoT and machine learning for remotely monitoring the health status of an expectant woman and her unborn child, to enhance early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia and improve birth outcomes. The study involved researching the on most appropriate biosensors and then designing and prototyping the pre-eclampsia watch. To build the pre-eclampsia prediction model the best ML algorithm was empirically analysed. A Naïve Bayes pre-eclampsia prediction model was found to perform better in identifying pregnant women who are at risk of pre-eclampsia after evaluation of various pre-eclampsia models built using decision trees, Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM) and Artificial neural networks (ANN). Lastly, the predictive model was integrated with the pre-eclampsia model to assist in early diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. The prototype generates alerts when the expectant woman is at risk of Pre-eclampsia. The pre-eclampsia watch model can securely capture and transmit expectant women's vital to the cloud for processing and provide timely alerts when the woman is at risk. Further research on the performance and efficacy of the model in a real environment will be done by experimenting with it in a purposively selected sample. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Arrhythmia disorders are the leading cause of death worldwide and are primarily recognized by the patient's irregular cardiac rhythms. Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can reliably measure patients' heart rhythms by producing electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Due to their non-invasive nature, ECG signals have been frequently employed to detect arrhythmias. The manual procedure, however, takes a long time and is prone to error. Utilizing deep learning models for early automatic identification of cardiac arrhythmias is a preferable approach that will improve diagnosis and therapy. Though ECG analysis using cloud-based methods can perform satisfactorily, they still suffer from security issues. It is essential to provide secure data transmission and storage for IoT medical data because of its significant development in the healthcare system. So, this paper proposes a secure arrhythmia classification system with the help of effective encryption and a deep learning (DL) system. The proposed method mainly involved two phases: ECG signal transmission and arrhythmia disease classification. In the ECG signal transmission phase, the patient's ECG data collected through the IoT sensors is encrypted using the optimal key-based elgamal elliptic curve cryptography (OKEGECC) mechanism, and the encrypted data is securely transmitted to the cloud. After that, in the arrhythmia disease classification phase, the system collects the data from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) database to perform training. The collected data is preprocessed by applying the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to improve the quality of the ECG data. Next, the feature extraction is carried out by deformable attention-centered residual network 50 (DARNet-50), and finally, the classification is performed using butterfly-optimized Bi-directional long short-term memory (BOBLSTM). The experimental outcomes showed that the proposed system achieves 99.76% accuracy, which is better than the existing related schemes.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)-based Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems provide real-time data and insights about patients' conditions without the need for constant physical visits to healthcare facilities. The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation. Thus the proposed model is reliable in improving the classification ratio and accuracy with fewer errors. The experimental values of the proposed model are as follows: IICM enhances classification by 6.65%, signal identification by 6.63%, and classification accuracy by 10.08%. This model reduces classification time by 9.51% and error by 10.14% for different ranges of inputs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor’s efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear’s efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Merging electrophysiology signal monitoring technology with wearable devices offers interesting future health care options. This study presented carbon-based screen-printing inks produced by mixing a graphite composite with a polymer emulsion to bind with flexible fabric substrates and tested with 10,000 bending cycles. The prepared carbon-based ink performed well for electrical conduction and vital signal response. Adding calcium carbonate resulted in a microstructure of graphite that decreased the electrical sheet resistance and resistance to 11.61 &#x03A9;&#x002F;&EmptySmallSquare; and 0.127 &#x03A9;. The signal-to-noise ratio of the electrocardiogram (ECG) was 31.02 dB with built-in front-end powering noise filtration. Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) was achieved by bio-impedance measurement and showed outstanding systolic and diastolic pressure values with a correlation coefficient of 0.799, and exhibited a similar interval time to define the same precise heart rate. The ECG data from the prepared electrode were applied to the machine learning models. The Random Forest (RF) model exhibited the optimized prediction value, with an F1 score of 99.9&#x0025;. Equipment made from carbon screen-printing inks showed potential for health care monitoring with no excessive pressure, dry processing, and repeatability as a flexible wearable bio-electronic device.

AB  - Pursuing high-performance conductive hydrogels is still hot topic in development of advanced flexible wearable devices. Herein, a tough, self-healing, adhesive double network (DN) conductive hydrogel (named as OSA-(Gelatin/PAM)-Ca, O-(G/P)-Ca) was prepared by bridging gelatin and polyacrylamide network with functionalized polysaccharide (oxidized sodium alginate, OSA) through Schiff base reaction. Thanks to the presence of multiple interactions (Schiff base bond, hydrogen bond, and metal coordination) within the network, the prepared hydrogel showed outstanding mechanical properties (tensile strain of 2800 % and stress of 630 kPa), high conductivity (0.72 S/m), repeatable adhesion performance and excellent self-healing ability (83.6 %/79.0 % of the original tensile strain/stress after self-healing). Moreover, the hydrogel-based sensor exhibited high strain sensitivity (GF = 3.66) and fast response time (<0.5 s), which can be used to monitor a wide range of human physiological signals. Based on this, excellent compression sensitivity (GF = 0.41 kPa−1 in the range of 90–120 kPa), a three-dimensional (3D) array of flexible sensor was designed to monitor the intensity of pressure and spatial force distribution. In addition, a gel-based wearable sensor was accurately classified and recognized ten types of gestures, achieving an accuracy rate of >96.33 % both before and after self-healing under three machine learning models (the decision tree, SVM, and KNN). This paper provides a simple method to prepare tough and self-healing conductive hydrogel as flexible multifunctional sensor devices for versatile applications in fields such as healthcare monitoring, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence. © 2024

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can be leveraged for periodic sensing and recording of different health parameters using sensors, wireless communications, and computation platforms. Health care systems can be enhanced by using IoMT for remote patient monitoring and data-driven diagnosis powered by machine learning algorithms. In the context of IoMT, federated learning (FL) is an excellent choice to manage machine learning (ML) algorithms to drive this analysis. This is because FL models can be trained in a distributed manner on local heterogeneous datasets that all contribute to the "collective wisdom". The model parameters can be regulated and shared without sharing the actual health data, ensuring confidentiality and security. This paper makes a case for the viability of FL-based analysis of data acquired via IoMT by presenting some use cases and recent work in this area and proposing a novel framework for data analysis using FL specifically in the context of mental stress detection. It shows that FL-based methods can significantly reduce the required communication overhead for each local device from 10.02MB/day up to only 754B/day as compared to non-FL techniques. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The widespread adoption of wearables, for example, smartphones and smartwatches in the daily lives of the general population, allows passive monitoring of physiological and behavioural data in the real world. This qualitative study explores the perspective of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients towards these so-called digital biomarkers (dBMs). METHODS: As part of a Design Thinking approach, six focus groups were conducted involving 27 PsA patients. The semistructured topic guide included disease activity, coping strategies, care needs, and potential advantages and disadvantages of dBMs. Thematic analysis followed an abductive coding method. RESULTS: PsA daily permeates patients' lives, both physically and mentally. Participants discussed how their lives are focused on minimising the impact of the disease on their daily routines. Their attempts to gain control over their disease highly depend on trial and error. Flare-ups are related to physiological as well as behavioural micro and macro changes. Understanding these changes could enable the detection of (early) flare. Participants elicited pros and cons of the use of dBMs, discussed their intended use and made practical remarks. This led to three main themes: 'Perceived dBM opportunities', 'Mapping Disease activity' and 'Perceived dBM barriers and pitfalls'. CONCLUSION: PsA patients are receptive to dBMs for tracking the disease symptoms. Disease activity is regarded multifaceted and thus, dBMs should include a broad range of features to truly reflect the disease activity status. Reducing the time of trial and error in learning to manage the disease is regarded beneficial. Establishing and maintaining the relationship with their attending physicians is a prerequisite, even if remote patient monitoring becomes an alternative for some physical hospital visits. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

AB  - Recent advancements in wearable smart devices, medical internet of things, cloud computing, wireless communications, and AI-based technologies have enabled personalized remote health care for patients with chronic diseases. Covid pandemic period has exposed the shortfall of the healthcare system, where there was a massive shortage of doctors, nurses, medical supplies, hospital beds, and other healthcare infrastructure, which has affected many patients with chronic diseases who needed constant monitoring and consultation with doctors. This has affirmed the necessity of remotely monitoring the patients to predict their requirements for medicines, treatment, etc., and to avoid any unusual severe condition. In this work, we presented the Patient Model to monitor the patient's activities and remotely identify and fulfil their treatment requirements. The framework monitors the patients and depending on the diagnosis provides personalized remote health care services such as telemedicine, medical tests, diet plans, etc., along with an ambulance facility if needed. The proposed framework uses a CNN and other machine learning algorithm to predict the required personalized healthcare service requirements. The simulation results show that the proposed framework, using the patient’s model, and CNN algorithm significantly improves the precision and recall of the prediction and reduces the time to predict the requirements. © 2024 Published by Faculty of Engineering.

AB  - Improving patient outcomes in critical care settings is significantly connected to effective ventilation control. This research introduces a new method for improving ventilation methods in critical healthcare utilizing a long short-term memory (LSTM) network hosted in the cloud. Ventilators, pulse oximeters, and capnography are just a few examples of medical equipment that input data into the system, which then uploads the data to the cloud for analysis. The LSTM network can learn from data patterns and correlations, drawing on respiratory parameters' time dynamics, to provide real-time suggestions and predictions for ventilation settings. The system aims to improve clinical results and reduce the risk of ventilator-induced lung damage by tailoring ventilation techniques according to each patient's requirements and by forecasting potential issues. Due to remote monitoring technology, medical professionals can quickly analyze their patient's conditions and act accordingly. The system allows for continuous improvement using iterative learning of more data and feedback. With the ability to optimize breathing and enhance patient care in critical healthcare situations, a hopeful development in airway management is needed. © 2025 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Rheumatologic diseases are marked by their complexity, involving immune-, metabolic- and mechanically mediated processes which can affect different organ systems. Despite a growing arsenal of targeted medications, many rheumatology patients fail to achieve full remission. Assessing disease activity remains challenging, as patients prioritize different symptoms and disease phenotypes vary. This is also reflected in clinical trials where the efficacy of drugs is not necessarily measured in an optimal way with the traditional outcome assessment. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed a digital transformation in healthcare, embracing telemonitoring and patient-reported data via apps and wearables. As a further driver of digital medicine, electronic medical record (EMR) providers are actively engaged in developing algorithms for clinical decision support, heralding a shift towards patient-centered, decentralized care. Machine learning algorithms have emerged as valuable tools for handling the increasing volume of patient data, promising to enhance treatment quality and patient well-being. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are particularly promising for radiological image analysis, aiding in the detection of specific lesions such as erosions, sacroiliitis, or osteoarthritis, with several FDA-approved applications. Clinical predictions, including numerical disease activity forecasts and medication choices, offer the potential to optimize treatment strategies. Numeric predictions can be integrated into clinical workflows, allowing for shared decision making with patients. Clustering patients based on disease characteristics provides a personalized care approach. Digital biomarkers, such as patient-reported outcomes and wearables data, offer insights into disease progression and therapy response more flexibly and outside patient consultations. In association with patient-reported outcomes, disease-specific digital biomarkers via image recognition or single-camera motion capture enables more efficient remote patient monitoring. Digital biomarkers may also play a major role in clinical trials in the future as continuous, disease-specific outcome measurement facilitating decentralized studies. Prediction models can help with patient selection in clinical trials, such as by predicting high disease activity. Efforts are underway to integrate these advancements into clinical workflows using digital pathways and remote patient monitoring platforms. In summary, machine learning, digital biomarkers, and advanced imaging technologies hold immense promise for enhancing clinical decision support and clinical trials in rheumatology. Effective integration will require a multidisciplinary approach and continued validation through prospective studies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Smart medical devices and the internet of things (IoT) have enhanced healthcare systems by allowing remote monitoring of patient's health. Because of the unexpected increase in the number of diabetes patients, it is critical to regularly evaluate patients' health conditions before any significant illness occurs. As a result of transmitting a large volume of sensitive medical data, dealing with IoT data security issues remains a difficult challenge. This paper presents a secure remote diabetes monitoring (SR-DM) model that uses hybrid encryption, combining the advanced encryption standard and elliptic curve cryptography (AES-ECC), to ensure the patients' sensitive data is protected in IoT platforms based on the cloud. The health statuses of patients are determined in this model by predicting critical situations using machine learning (ML) algorithms for analyzing medical data sensed by smart health IoT devices. The results reveal that the AES-ECC approach has a significant influence on cloud-based IoT systems and the random forest (RF) classification method outperforms with a high accuracy of 91.4%. As a consequence of the outcomes obtained, the proposed model effectively establishes a secure and efficient system for remote health monitoring. © 2024 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Apart from providing user-friendly applications that support digitized healthcare routines, the use of wearable devices has proven to increase the independence of patients in a healthcare setting. By applying machine learning techniques to real health-related data, important conclusions can be drawn for unsolved issues related to disease prognosis. In this paper, various machine learning techniques are examined and analyzed for the provision of personalized care to COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms based on individual characteristics and the comorbidities they have, while the connection between the stimuli and predictive results are utilized for the evaluation of the system’s transparency. The results, jointly analyzing wearable and electronic health record data for the prediction of a daily dyspnea grade and the duration of fever, are promising in terms of evaluation metrics even in a specified stratum of patients. The interpretability scheme provides useful insight concerning factors that greatly influenced the results. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the use of wearable devices for remote monitoring through cloud platforms is feasible while providing awareness of a patient’s condition, leading to the early detection of undesired changes and reduced visits for patient screening. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - In several nations, the majority of heart attacks lead to fatality prior to patients receiving any kind of medical intervention. The traditional healthcare system is mostly passive, requiring patients to initiate contact with healthcare services independently. People often do not request the treatment if they are unconscious during a heart disease episode. The use of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) methods offers significant advantages in addressing the issue of caring for patients with cardiac problems. These techniques may transform service delivery into ubiquitous and activate healthcare services. Low-cost remote monitoring systems are essential to implementing a widespread healthcare service. In this article, we proposed a cost-effective Personal Health Care Device(PHCD) based on the Internet of Things (IoT). The PHCD transmits user somatic signals to data acquisition devices using a LoRa (Long-range and low-power) wireless communication network. The received data is uploaded to the cloud using IoT platforms like Adafruit IO. Further, various Machine learning (ML) algorithms, Naïve Bayes, ANN, CNN, and LSTM, were applied to collected data to predict heart rate and SpO2 behavior. The performance results of different forecast models were compared to identify precise modeling and reliable forecasts to prevent emergency cardiovascular conditions. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group.

AB  - Real-time monitoring of gait characteristics is crucial for applications in health monitoring, patient rehabilitation feedback, and telemedicine. However, the effective and stable acquisition and automatic analysis of gait information remain significant challenges. In this study, we present a flexible sensor based on a carbon nanotube/graphene composite conductive leather (CGL), which uses collagen fiber with a three-dimensional network structure as the flexible substrate. The CGL-based sensor demonstrates a high dynamic range, with notable pressure responses ranging from 0.6 to 14.5 kPa and high sensitivity (S = 0.2465 kPa-1). We further developed a device incorporating the CGL-based sensor to collect foot characteristic signals from human motion and designed smart sports shoes to facilitate effective human-computer interaction. Machine learning was employed to collect and process gait characteristic information in various states, including standing, sitting, walking, and falling. For real-time monitoring of falls, we optimized the K-Nearest Time Series Classifier (KNTC) algorithm, achieving an accuracy of 0.99 and a prediction time of only 13 ms, which highlights the system’s excellent intelligent response capabilities. The system maintained a gait recognition accuracy of 90% across diverse populations, with low false-positive (3.3%) and false-negative (3.3%) rates. This work demonstrates stable gait recognition capabilities and provides valuable methods and insights for plantar behavior monitoring and data analysis, contributing to the development of advanced real-time gait monitoring systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Categorizing Artificial Intelligence of Medical Things (AIoMT) devices within the realm of standard Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, particularly at the server and computational layers, poses a formidable challenge. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for categorizing AIoMT devices through the application of decentralized processing, referred to as "Federated Learning" (FL). Our approach involves deploying a system on standard IoT devices and labeled IoMT devices for training purposes and attribute extraction. Through this process, we extract and map the interconnected attributes from a global federated cum aggression server. The aim of this terminology is to extract interdependent devices via federated learning, ensuring data privacy and adherence to operational policies. Consequently, a global training dataset repository is coordinated to establish a centralized indexing and synchronization knowledge repository. The categorization process employs generic labels for devices transmitting medical data through regular communication channels. We evaluate our proposed methodology across a variety of IoT, IoMT, and AIoMT devices, demonstrating effective classification and labeling. Our technique yields a reliable categorization index for facilitating efficient access and optimization of medical devices within global servers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the age of data science, voice data can be treated as one of the crucial assets used for strengthening biometrics technologies and biomedical applications. However, voice biometrics is still at emergence state facing voice variability, cross-linguistic variations, and voice spoofing challenges. These long-standing issues are proposed to be solved by deploying an organic, flexible, and printed piezoelectric polymeric interface exhibiting several unique features such as strong directionality, stability over a large operating temperature range (30–90 ˚C), broad frequency (6 kHz), ultra sensitivity (5.77 V Pa−1) and high signal-to-noise ratio (38–55 dB). By analyzing speech processing parameters acquired by the voice sensor, an individual voiceprint is established, which is further utilized to train a neural network model for deploying artificial intelligence (AI)-driven voice biometrics, resulting in a remarkable accuracy of >96% for population identification and speaker recognition and >93% for healthcare assessment. Featuring a versatile printing fabrication process, innovative voiceprint approach, and a robust neural network, the programmable polymeric acoustic interface proposes a promising complementary tool to the existing biometrics technologies and plays a vital role in healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Piezoresistive sensors are indispensable in applications such as healthcare monitoring, artificial intelligence, and advanced communication systems. However, achieving wearable sensors that offer both high sensitivity and a wide linear range remains a significant challenge. Here, an all-carbon piezoresistive sensor is presented, named, featuring high biocompatibility, chemical stability, environmental sustainability, and a straightforward fabrication process. This sensor, integrating a double-sided pyramidal carbon aerogel (DPA) as the sensing layer, a silicone frame as the elastic support (ES), and superhydrophobic graphene-coated nylon fabric as the breathable conductive substrate (BCS), was named as DPA-ES@BCS. Finite element analysis confirms that the synergistic interaction between the DPA and silicone frame enhances the sensor's sensitivity while extending its linear range. This multiscale design achieves an exceptional sensitivity of 37.3 kPa−1, a broad linear detection ranges from 0 to 1.4 MPa, and outstanding stability over 30 000 cycles. Additionally, the high-performance wearable sensor is well-suited for real-time physiological signal monitoring and demonstrates exceptional capability in voice recognition, accurately distinguishing words using machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the DPA-ES@BCS sensor array shows great potential for enhancing information security through dual-factor authentication. This approach not only advances the piezoresistive performance of all-carbon sensors but also provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation sensor technologies. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - The goal of this research is to create an ensemble deep learning model for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that specifically target remote patient monitoring (RPM) by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) networks and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care. This study shows how using ensemble models' advantages might improve health monitoring's precision and promptness, which would eventually benefit patients and ease the burden on healthcare systems. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Patients with advanced heart failure, due to the instability of their clinical conditions, need close surveillance to avoid dangerous exacerbations or sudden events. Digital technology can be of great help in this contest, thanks to remote monitoring, made possible with the use of wearable or implantable instruments. The latter are currently generally inserted inside defibrillators or resynchronization systems, or inserted inside the pulmonary circulation for monitoring pulmonary pressure. Parameters such as thoracic impedance, physical activity, heart rate variability, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, blood pressure, and O2 saturation can be controlled remotely. The data relating to the actual benefit in terms of avoidable events (death and hospitalizations) are not definitive, but certainly from an organizational point of view, the benefit is evident, both on the part of the patient and of the organization of care. The latter, provided in the form of televisits, requires a re-modulation of the system, making use of trained personnel, a well- structured network, and digital technologies (platforms, electronic health records) that are not yet perfectly developed. The evolution of the solutions offered by artificial intelligence guarantees a rapid and progressive refinement of telemedicine in this sector.  © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study used electrocardiogram data in conjunction with artificial intelligence methods as a noninvasive tool for detecting peripartum cardiomyopathy. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of an artificial intelligence-based heart failure detection model for peripartum cardiomyopathy detection. STUDY DESIGN: We first built a deep-learning model for heart failure detection using retrospective data at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. Cases were adult and nonpregnant female patients with a heart failure diagnosis; controls were adult nonpregnant female patients without heart failure. The model was then tested on an independent cohort of pregnant women at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center with or without peripartum cardiomyopathy. We also tested the model in an external cohort of pregnant women at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. Key outcomes were assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. We also repeated our analysis using only lead I electrocardiogram as an input to assess the feasibility of remote monitoring via wearables that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. RESULTS: The University of Tennessee Health Science Center heart failure cohort comprised 346,339 electrocardiograms from 142,601 patients. In this cohort, 60% of participants were Black and 37% were White, with an average age (standard deviation) of 53 (19) years. The heart failure detection model achieved an area under the curve of 0.92 on the holdout set. We then tested the ability of the heart failure model to detect peripartum cardiomyopathy in an independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort of pregnant women and an external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort of pregnant women. The independent University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort included 158 electrocardiograms from 115 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.83 (0.77–0.89) for this data set. The external Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort involved 80 electrocardiograms from 43 patients; our deep-learning model achieved an area under the curve of 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for this data set. For identifying peripartum cardiomyopathy diagnosed ≥10 days after delivery, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.88 (0.81–0.94) for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center cohort and of 0.96 (0.93–0.99) for the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohort. When we repeated our analysis by building a heart failure detection model using only lead-I electrocardiograms, we obtained similarly high detection accuracies, with areas under the curve of 0.73 and 0.93 for the University of Tennessee Health Science Center and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSION: Artificial intelligence can accurately detect peripartum cardiomyopathy from electrocardiograms alone. A simple electrocardiographic artificial intelligence–based peripartum screening could result in a timelier diagnosis. Given that results with 1-lead electrocardiogram data were similar to those obtained using all 12 leads, future studies will focus on remote screening for peripartum cardiomyopathy using smartwatches that can capture single-lead electrocardiogram data. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Innovative research works in the healthcare sector keep on advancing every day. As the “Internet of Things (IoT)” keeps on evolving, the application of IoT in the medical field is prominent these days. Utilizing IoT devices, alert messages can be sent directly to medical professionals in case of an emergency. So, monitoring the health condition of an individual using IoT technology has become a popular and beneficial method in today's contemporary medical field. With the help of mobile IoT medical equipment, the technology of smart Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) is proliferating. By utilizing deep learning and IoT technology, the medical diagnosis system has evolved from direct face-to-face visits to the hospital to remote telemedicine method. Most of the data generated by the IoT wearable sensors are highly correlated and may consist of outliers. The extraction of the essential attributes from these data is a complicated task. So, “deep learning and machine learning” techniques are adapted to determine the most relevant and appropriate feature required for efficient diagnosis from the unstructured data produced by the IoT devices and thus help in minimizing the redundancy of unnecessary data. Fusing deep learning methods with healthcare IoT made only the essential details to be available for diagnosis. Therefore, a deep learning-oriented IoT-based HMS is executed in this work. With the support of several wearable healthcare devices, the required data are acquired. The encryption of the data acquired from standard sources using Optimal Key-based Advanced Encryption Standard (OK-AES) is carried out next to assure the security of the sensitive medical data. The keys for AES encryption are optimally chosen with the aid of the Enhanced Heap-Based Optimizer Algorithm (EHBOA). The encrypted data is transferred to the “cloud platform” for data storage. Once there is a need for the data, then the encrypted data is initially downloaded from the cloud platform. Then using the same AES scheme, the decryption of the data to attain the original data is carried out. From the retrieved data, the extraction of the crucial attributes is carried out. The extracted features are chosen in an optimized manner and are concatenated with the tuned weights to form the weighted feature matrix. This formulated weighted feature matrix is provided as input to the “Adaptive Dilated Transformer Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (ADTBi-LSTM-GRU) model.” The variables in the ADTBG are optimized using the EHBOA for providing an accurate classification outcome. The classified disease outcome is obtained from the deployed ADTBi-LSTM-GRU model. Simulations are done to verify the efficiency and reliability of the implemented deep learning and IoT-based HMS. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, healthcare monitoring systems (HMS) have increasingly integrated the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with cloud computing, leading to challenges related to data latency and efficient processing. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a Machine Learning-based Medical Data Segmentation (ML-MDS) approach that employs a k-fold random forest technique for efficient health data classification and latency reduction in a fog-cloud environment. Our method significantly improves latency issues, enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) in healthcare systems and demonstrating its adaptability in heterogeneous network scenarios. We specifically employ the Random Forest algorithm to mitigate the common problem of overfitting in machine learning models, ensuring broader applicability across various healthcare contexts. Additionally, by optimizing data processing in fog computing layers, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall latency between healthcare sensors and cloud servers. This improvement is evidenced through a comparative performance analysis with existing models. The proposed framework not only ensures secure and scalable management of IoMT health data but also incorporates a stochastic approach to mathematically formulate performance indicators for the HMS queuing model. This model effectively predicts system response times and assesses the computing resources required under varying workload conditions. Our simulation results show a classification accuracy of 92%, a 56% reduction in latency compared to existing models, and an overall enhancement in e-healthcare service quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - The growing incorporation of interconnected healthcare equipment, software, networks, and operating systems into the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) poses a risk of security breaches. This is because the IoMT devices lack adequate safeguards against cyberattacks. To address this issue, this article presents a proposed framework for detecting anomalies and cyberattacks. The proposed integrated model employs the 1) K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, while 2) utilizing long-short term memory (LSTM) for feature extraction, and 3) applying Principal component analysis (PCA) to modify and reduce the features. PCA subsequently enhances the important temporal characteristics identified by the LSTM network. The parameters of the KNN classifier were confirmed by using fivefold cross-validation after making hyperparameter adjustments. The evaluation of the proposed model involved the use of four datasets: 1) telemetry operating system network internet-of-things (TON-IoT), 2) Edith Cowan University-Internet of Health Things (ECU-IoHT) dataset, 3) intensive care unit (ICU) dataset, and 4) Washington University in St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Surveillance System (WUSTL-EHMS) dataset. The proposed model achieved 99.9% accuracy, recall, F1 score, and precision on the WUSTL-EHMS dataset. The proposed technique efficiently mitigates cyber threats in healthcare environments. © 2024

AB  - Medical Internet of Things technology can effectively enable remote physiological data collection, monitoring, and transmission by integrating flexible sensors, wireless communication, and the human body in a wearable and embedded manner. Herein, a stretchable elastomer optical fiber has been developed and sandwiched with two performance of polymethyl methacrylate optical fibers to form a fully flexible polymer optical fiber sensor. The optical fiber integrated with the system mainly consists of a microcomputer, a light-emitting diode (LED) driver, a LED light source, a photodiode, and a Bluetooth module. One intelligent wearable photonic sensing system has been developed based on the Beer-Lambert law of the stretchable elastomer optical fiber for remote healthcare monitoring. Benefiting from the use of elastomer polymer materials, the sensing system features a maximum strain of more than 250%, a high-tensile strain of up to 100%, and a durability of >500 tests. Also, based on the advantage of elastomer optical fiber, the sensing part can be flexibly pasted on the skin surface as a wearable device for real-time monitoring of multiple physiological parameters. In this study, we successfully realized the monitoring of breathing pattern, heart rate, pulse, facial micro-activity, and joint activity, and the recognition of articulatory activity and knee joint activity using a 1-D convolutional neural network, with an accuracy of more than 90% for each activity recognition. Such merits demonstrate its potential as a medical toolkit and indicate promise for remote healthcare monitoring.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Conditions affecting the circulatory system and blood vessels are referred to as cardiovascular diseases that include strokes and heart attacks. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies monitor health metrics, identify irregularities and enable remote patient care, resulting in earlier intervention and more individualized therapy. This research aims to establish an efficient cardiovascular disease prediction model through Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven IoT technology. We propose a novel Shuffled Frog leaping-tuned Iterative Improved Adaptive Boosting (SF-IIAdaboost) algorithm for predicting cardiovascular disease with the implementation of IoT device data. IoT medical sensors and wearable devices will collect the patient's clinical data in our proposed framework. Z-score normalization is used to preprocess the gathered data and optimize its quality. Kernel principal component analysis (Kernel-PCA) extracts the relevant features from the processed data. We obtained a dataset that contains various health data gathered from numerous sensing devices to train our recommended model. Our proposed methodology is implemented using Python software. During the evaluation phase, we assess the effectiveness of our model across different parameters. We conduct comparative analyses against conventional methods to ascertain the superiority of our approach. Experimental findings demonstrate the superior performance of our recognition method over traditional approaches. The proposed SF-IIAdaboost algorithm, integrated with IoT device data, presents a promising avenue for predicting cardiovascular disease. The SF-IIAdaboost model demonstrated notable enhancements, attaining 95.37 % accuracy, 93.51 % precision, 94.3 % sensitivity, 96.31 % specificity, and 95.72 % F-measure. Future developments are predicted to involve computing on the edge, where immediate evaluations can be performed in the edge layer to avoid the basic constraints of the clouds, such as high latency, utilization of bandwidth and performing the growth of IoT data. Edge computing can revolutionize the healthcare industry's efficacy by enabling providers to make flexible decisions, operate quickly, and accurately anticipate diseases. It can improve the average level of service standards. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background/Objectives: Early identification of complications in chronic and infectious diseases can reduce clinical deterioration, lead to early therapeutic interventions and lower morbidity and mortality rates. Here, we aimed to assess the feasibility of a novel clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on the automatic generation of alerts through remote patient monitoring and to identify the patient profile associated with the likelihood of severe medical alerts. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with COVID-19 in home isolation were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either conventional primary care telephone follow-up plus access to a mobile app for self-reporting of symptoms (control group) or conventional primary care telephone follow-up plus access to the mobile app for self-reporting of symptoms and wearable devices for real-time telemonitoring of vital signs (case group). Results: A total of 342 patients were randomized, of whom 247 were included in the per-protocol analysis (103 cases and 144 controls). The case group received a more exhaustive follow-up, with a higher number of alerts (61,827 vs. 1825; p < 0.05) but without overloading healthcare professionals thanks to automatic alert management through artificial intelligence. Baseline factors independently associated with the likelihood of a severe alert were having asthma (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.22–2.48, p = 0.002) and taking corticosteroids (OR: 2.28, 95% CI: 1.24–4.2, p = 0.008). Conclusions: The CDSS could be successfully implemented and enabled real-time telemonitoring of patients’ clinical status, providing valuable information to physicians and public health agencies. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The aim of this pilot study was to assess the compliance of breast cancer (BC) patients with fitness tracker (FT) monitoring program during radiotherapy (RT) and to characterize radiation-induced fatigue (RIF) status through objective evaluation using FT-collected parameters. Thirty-six BC patients were invited to wear FT during their RT course for continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR) and step counts (STP). RIF assessment was performed weekly, according to CTCAE v5.0 and dichotomized into G0 vs. any-grade. A novel concept based on patient Repeated Activity Window (RAW) was introduced to evaluate HR and STP variations during RT. Several Machine Learning (ML) methods were trained to characterize RIF on the basis of HR and STP collected data. RIF of any grade was reported by 17 out of 36 patients (47%) included in the study. None of patient clinical variables were significantly correlated with RIF. All patients accepted the FT monitoring program, and for 32 patients FT collection efficiency was greater than 60%. For each patient, a distinct distribution of RAWs was identifiable over RT and across the entire patient cohort, with a total of 7950 RAWs processed. Six features related to RAWs, HR and STP were identified as associated with RIF. The best-performing classifier was the Bagged Trees model, showing a cross-validated ROC-AUC of 89% (95% CI 88–90%). This study confirms the feasibility of continuous biomedical monitoring of BC patients by FT. We successfully identify objective indicators of RIF through HR and STP variation measures within each patient’s RAW, thus providing a novel and practical approach to assess and manage RIF. This can significantly aid medical staff in evaluating RIF trajectories, potentially leading to better individualized care strategies and improved patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Millions of individuals globally suffer with diabetes mellitus, a prevalent chronic illness that requires prompt and correct diagnosis for successful management and the avoidance of complica-tions. In real-time scenarios, such as remote healthcare monitoring and emergency situations, rapid and precise diabetes diagnosis becomes paramount. This research introduces an innovative approach to enhance diabetes diagnosis in real-time by leveraging Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs) and data mining techniques. The proposed system harnesses the capabilities of MANETs to establish dynamic and ad hoc communication networks among medical devices, wearable sensors, and health-care professionals’ mobile devices. These networks facilitate the seamless exchange of patient data, including glucose levels, insulin records, and vital signs, enabling timely and continuous monitoring of diabetes patients regardless of their geographical location. Data mining techniques, specifically machine learning algorithms, are employed to analyse the vast amounts of patient data collected through the MANET. The system uses these algorithms to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends from the data, thus assisting in the real-time diagnosis and personalised management of diabetes. Machine learning models are trained to predict glucose fluctuations, identify potential hyperglycemic or hypoglycemic events, and offer treatment recommendations based on historical and real-time data. To validate the system’s efficacy, extensive simulations and real-world trials were conducted across a diverse group of diabetes patients. The results demonstrate significant im-provements in early diagnosis accuracy, prediction of critical events, and individualised treatment strategies, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs. The system’s ability to provide timely interventions and empower healthcare providers with data-driven insights holds promise for revolutionising diabetes care, particularly in remote or resource-constrained settings. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Purpose As the global population continue to age, tracking vital signs such as heart rate becomes crucial (Dias & Paulo Silva Cunha, 2018). However, traditional methods for monitoring these vital signs, particularly through wearable sensors, often present challenges. As noted in the study (Vijayan, Connolly, Condell, McKelvey, & Gardiner, 2021), wearables can be cumbersome for users, particularly older adults who may find these devices uncomfortable or intrusive, potentially leading to low adherence and compromising the reliability of health data collection. However, the rise of non-invasive Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technology offers a more accessible solution (Lussier et al., 2020). By utilizing sensors embedded within the living environment, AAL systems can continuously gather vital health data without requiring direct interaction or causing discomfort to the individual. This research focuses on merging effortless smart home ambient technology and machine learning to predict the heart rate of old individuals. The primary aim is to accurately monitor heart rate during daily activities using non-intrusive, remote methods facilitated by AAL technology, without requiring active participation from the subjects. Method This study was conducted in a specially designed smart home environment (Figure 1) equipped with a wide range of non-contact ambient sensors, which were used to collect environmental, electrical, and presence data. Heart rate benchmark data was collected using the Empatica E4 wristband. Forty participants were selected and instructed to perform 23 specific daily activities, organized into five practical phases, within this smart home setting. The data collected from the smart home environment and the heart rate readings were subsequently analyzed using five widely used machine learning methods: Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron. Results and Discussion The machine learning models delivered notable predictive results, averaging a Mean Absolute Error of 7.329. Notably, the Random Forest model excelled above the rest, registering a Mean Absolute Error of 6.023 and a Scatter Index at 9.72%. This model excelled in identifying the correlation between daily activities and fluctuations in heart rate, showcasing a peak R2 value of 0.782 during the activity of morning exercises. The proposed non-invasive method offers a novel perspective on remote monitoring heart rate variations across daily living activities. This study's insights hold substantial relevance for public health. Leveraging contact-free smart home tech to estimate heart rate during everyday tasks allows health professionals to grasp a person's cardiovascular health more holistically. Such insights pave the way for tailored interventions, preventive actions, and lifestyle changes, ultimately aiming to lower cardiovascular disease risks and enhance overall health. © (2024), (International Society for Gerontechnology).

AB  - Introduction: The advent of digital and mobile health innovations, especially use of wearables for passive data collection, allows remote monitoring and creates an abundance of data. For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. Research question: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? Methods: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. Results: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). Significance: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - As Canada’s population of older adults rises, the need for aging-in-place solutions is growing due to the declining quality of long-term-care homes and long wait times. While the current standards include questionnaire-based assessments for monitoring activities of daily living (ADLs), there is an urgent need for advanced indoor localization technologies that ensure privacy. This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Starting from the escalating global burden of mental health disorders, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize mental health care. With nearly one in five adults facing mental health issues and suicide ranking as a leading cause of death among the young, the strained mental health system seeks innovative solutions. The text discusses the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in image analysis for early physical health diagnoses, and its promising applications in mental health, including predictive analytics for various disorders. AI’s ability to analyze written language, speech characteristics, and physiological signals from wearables offers avenues for remote monitoring and early prognosis. Despite the need to address ethical considerations, particularly biases in data sets and concerns about potential patient detachment, the article advocates for AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human involvement in mental health services. Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in enhancing diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies for mental health disorders. © 2024 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

AB  - Wheezing is a critical indicator of various respiratory conditions, including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The advancement of medical technology has brought about a significant transformation in remote healthcare monitoring, which is crucial for providing customized care and ongoing observation. This is especially important when it comes to controlling long-term illnesses like high blood pressure, which raises the risk of heart disease considerably, especially in older people. This methodology achieves greater accuracy by combining regular medical monitoring and Electronic Clinical Data (ECD) from complete medical records with physical data from patients' routine medical monitoring. This innovative technique enhances the area of cardiac disease prediction. A technique that uses cutting-edge machine learning models and IoT technology to meet this demand. In particular, we use the powerful Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to effectively examine big datasets and extract important characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. The deep learning model Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) is used to further enhance prediction skills to extract complex temporal patterns from patient data. It outperformed naive Bayes, decision trees, and random forests with our approach, achieving a greater prediction accuracy of 99.4 %. With the combination of Internet of Things technologies and sophisticated machine learning models, this paper offers a novel approach to remote healthcare monitoring. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research paper monitors the patient’s health using sensor data, cloud, and big data Hadoop tools and used to predict heart attack and related results were discussed in detail. The integration of big data, and wearable sensors in pervasive computing has significantly enhanced healthcare services. This proposal focuses on developing an advanced healthcare monitoring system tailored for tracking the activities of elderly individuals. The wearable sensors are placed on humans at a right angle, left arm, right arm, and chest to collect the data. The large data are split into smaller segments using the map and reduce process of big data Hadoop tools. The intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) approach is used for the mapping phase and deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), deep belief network (DBN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) and proposed deep learning heart rate prediction (DLHRP) algorithms are used for the combiner/reduce phase. The reduction process combines similar segments of data to predict identical classes to predict the severity of human conditions. The proposed IMRT-DLHRP system has improved performance of 96.34% accuracy compared with 84.25%, 89.47%, and 91.58% compared to DCNN, DBN, and LSTM respectively, therefore proposed framework has significant improvement over existing approaches. © 2025 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - By facilitating the modification of a particular health condition under certain circumstances, personalised healthcare services usually function in the most stringent manner. Patient Healthcare Services Monitoring (PHSM) is an interconnected system of all accessible health services that allows for the quick exchange of data over the Internet. Data collection and processing are the backbone of every PHSM program. The incorporation of machine learning algorithms into PHSM-IoT is crucial because of the massive amounts of data stored in healthcare and the great need of precise forecasts.

AB  - Flexible and wearable devices play a pivotal role in the realm of smart portable electronics due to their diverse applications in healthcare monitoring, soft robotics, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. Nonetheless, the extensive integration of intelligent wearable sensors into mass production faces challenges within a resource-limited environment, necessitating low-cost manufacturing, high reliability, stability, and multi-functionality. In this study, a cost-effective fiber laser direct writing method (fLDW) was illustrated to create highly responsive and robust flexible sensors. These sensors integrate laser-induced graphene (LiG) with mixed metal oxides on a flexible polyimide film. fLDW simplifies the synthesis of graphene, functionalization of carbon structures into graphene oxides and reduced graphene oxides, and deposition of metal-oxide nanoparticles within a single experimental laser writing setup. The preparation and surface modification of dense oxygenated graphene networks and semiconducting metal oxide nanoparticles (CuOx, ZnOx, FeOx) enables rapid fabrication of LiG/MOx composite sensors with the ability to detect and differentiate various stimuli, including visible light, UV light, temperature, humidity, and magnetic fluxes. Further, this in situ customizability of fLDW-produced sensors allows for tunable sensitivity, response time, recovery time, and selectivity. The normalized current gain of resistive LiG/MOx sensors can be controlled between −2.7 to 3.5, with response times ranging from 0.02 to 15 s, and recovery times from 0.04 to 6 s. Furthermore, the programmable properties showed great endurance after 200 days in air and extended bend cycles. Collectively, these LiG/MOx sensors stand as a testament to the effectiveness of fLDW in economically mass-producing flexible and wearable electronic devices to meet the explicit demands of the Internet of Things. © 2025 RSC.

AB  - In recent times, there has been a notable rise in the utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) frameworks particularly those based on edge computing, to enhance remote monitoring in healthcare applications. Most existing models in this field have been developed temperature screening methods using RCNN, face temperature encoder (FTE), and a combination of data from wearable sensors for predicting respiratory rate (RR) and monitoring blood pressure. These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19. However, these models require inadequate computing resources and are not suitable for lightweight environments. We propose a multimodal screening framework that leverages deep learning-inspired data fusion models to enhance screening results. A Variation Encoder (VEN) design proposes to measure skin temperature using Regions of Interest (RoI) identified by YoLo. Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances. Simulation results using our lab dataset demonstrate a precision of 95.2&#x0025;, surpassing state-of-the-art models due to the thoughtful design of the multimodal data-based feature fusion model, weight prediction factor, and feature selection model.

AB  - The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization. © 2024 Aslam et al.

AB  - The promise of remote patient monitoring (RPM) lies in its ability to revolutionize health care delivery by enabling continuous, real-time tracking of patient health outside traditional clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of RPM, particularly in underserved and rural populations, highlighting both its potential and the persistent barriers that limit its widespread use. This paper explores the critical role of technological advancements—such as wear-ables, artificial intelligence (AI), and broadband expansion—in sustaining and optimizing RPM in the postpandemic era. We examine Michigan as a microcosm of national health care challenges, focusing on its diverse population and geographic barriers, and propose condition-specific RPM protocols to address these inequities. Key facilitators and barriers to RPM implementation are discussed, with a focus on AI integration, community engagement, and digital infrastructure. We also explore the role of policy reform and public–private partnerships in supporting RPM’s scalability and long-term sustainability. Our findings suggest that while RPM offers a powerful tool for improving health care access and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions and rural maternal health, sustained investment in technology and infrastructure is critical. By addressing these challenges, RPM can become a cornerstone of modern health care, reducing disparities and improving care delivery for underserved populations. © MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC.

AB  - Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different from those familiar to today's providers. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) initiatives that aim to integrate technology and medicine are shaking the sector to its foundations. The revolutionary potential of the proposed strategy is shown here as we investigate the far-reaching consequences of the Healthcare IoT on remote patient monitoring. The beginning sets the stage by underlining the significance of bridging the gap between technology and medicine. Our multi-pronged approach comprises Internet of Things (IoT) remote monitoring, cloud-based analysis, artificial intelligence (AI) integrated diagnostics, real-time alerts, and predictive analytics. Our study's results demonstrate that the proposed approach is superior to the status quo. The area of remote patient monitoring has profited considerably from the employment of traditional approaches, such as the fusion of data from wearable sensors, analysis in the cloud, diagnostics that utilize artificial intelligence, real-time monitoring, predictive modeling, and smart alarm systems. The suggested strategy, however, performs very well across all of the most important measures of assessment. Comparatively, the accuracy rate of the conventional wearable sensor fusion approach was only 76%, whereas our suggested method reached 89%. Our strategy was also more accurate than the standard approach (88% vs. 73%). When compared to the recall rate of 68% produced by conventional methods, our suggested strategy significantly outperformed the competition. It's a great option for hospitals and clinics since it improves diagnostic precision and speed without breaking the bank. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is an emerging technology that combines the Internet of Things (IoT) into the healthcare sector, which brings remarkable benefits to facilitate remote patient monitoring and reduce treatment costs. As IoMT devices become more scalable, Smart Healthcare Systems (SHS) have become increasingly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in maintaining network security. An IDS monitors systems or networks for suspicious activities or potential threats, safeguarding internal networks. This paper presents the development of an IDS based on deep learning techniques utilizing benchmark datasets. We propose a multilayer perceptron-based framework for intrusion detection within the smart healthcare domain. The primary objective of our work is to protect smart healthcare devices and networks from malicious attacks and security risks. We employ the NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15 intrusion detection datasets to evaluate our proposed security framework. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 95.0674%, surpassing that of comparable deep learning models in smart healthcare while also reducing the false positive rate. Experimental results indicate the feasibility of using a multilayer perceptron, achieving superior performance against cybersecurity threats in the smart healthcare domain.

AB  - Remote patient monitoring has recently been popularised due to advanced technological innovations. The advent of the Sixth Generation Internet of Things (6G-IoT) communication technology, combined with deep learning algorithms, presents a groundbreaking opportunity for enhancing remote cardiac system monitoring. This paper proposes an innovative framework leveraging the ultra-reliable, low-latency communication capabilities of 6G-IoT to transmit real-time cardiac data from wearable devices directly to healthcare providers. Integrating deep learning models facilitates the accurate analysis and prediction of cardiac anomalies, significantly improving traditional monitoring systems. Our methodology involves the deployment of cutting-edge wearable sensors capable of capturing high-fidelity cardiac signals. These signals are transmitted via 6G-IoT networks, ensuring minimal delay and maximum reliability. Upon receiving the data, a densely connected deep neural network with an optimised swish activation function—designed explicitly for cardiac anomaly detection is employed to analyse the data in real-time. These algorithms are trained on vast datasets to recognise patterns indicative of potential cardiac issues, allowing immediate intervention when necessary. The proposed system’s efficacy is validated through extensive testing in simulated environments, demonstrating its ability to accurately detect and swiftly predict a wide range of cardiac conditions. Moreover, implementing 6G-IoT communication ensures the system's scalability and adaptability to future technological advancements. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

The increased popularity of IoT and smart devices has resulted in a menace as most users’ data is stored on these devices, making them a potential target for network attacks. Thus, it becomes extremely imperative to address malware threats in IoT devices. To combat this problem, the paper presents a detailed investigation to analyze the behavior of IoT malware using network forensics of six IoT botnets. We performed modeling on 55 IoT botnet samples from Twitter Honeypot. We performed botnet analysis in two dimensions: Activities and Networks. We examined botnet activities in terms of vulnerable ports, popular geolocations, protocols, and attack vectors. In terms of its topological features, severity, and packet length. To detect the botnet category, we applied six machine learning classifiers. Neural networks attained the best precision. © 2024 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The remote monitoring of vital signs and healthcare provision has become an urgent necessity due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world. Blood oxygen level, heart rate, and body temperature data are crucial for managing the disease and ensuring timely medical care. This study proposes a low-cost wearable device employing non-contact sensors to monitor, process, and visualize critical variables, focusing on body temperature measurement as a key health indicator. The wearable device developed offers a non-invasive and continuous method to gather wrist and forehead temperature data. However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches. It achieves an R2 value of 0.9769 in the statistical analysis and 0.9791 in machine learning. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The possibility of remotely monitoring and managing chronic diseases is made feasible by the Internet of Things (IoT), which enables the collection and analysis of vast amounts of data from various sources such as sensors, devices, and wearables. However, conventional machine learning approaches often encounter difficulties when dealing with IoT data due to its noise, heterogeneity, and high dimensions. In this study, we introduce a novel technique for developing human-centric intelligent systems for remote monitoring of chronic diseases using deep learning in an IoT context. This technique is capable of handling complex and diverse IoT data, providing accurate and comprehensible predictions and recommendations. We outline a standardized architecture for these systems, comprising of three distinct phases: data acquisition, data processing, and data visualization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we apply it to a case study involving the development and evaluation of a human-centered intelligent system for remote monitoring of hypertension and diabetic patients, involving real users. Our findings reveal a substantial enhancement in prediction accuracy when employing our proposed hybrid algorithm. When compared to traditional algorithms, our proposed hybrid algorithm exhibits superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, surpassing the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with an accuracy of 88.2%, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks at 90.4%, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at 91.6%. This improvement in accuracy is critical for ensuring reliable disease monitoring and management, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. In terms of precision, scalability, and user satisfaction, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we address the social and ethical implications inherent in our methodology and suggest avenues for future research in this domain. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth's capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Currently, healthcare systems operate under conventional management practices and entail storing and processing substantial medical data. Integrating the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technologies has facilitated the development of IoT-enabled healthcare, which possesses advanced data processing capabilities and extensive data storage. This paper proposes a WSN and IoT framework for patient monitoring in high-speed 5G communications. Based on an artificial neural network (ANN), an intelligent health monitoring system was developed using IoT technology to monitor a person's blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen level, and temperature. Furthermore, the system helps the elderly being in critical cases in their homes to communicate and update their medical condition with the hospital, especially in critical cases, to be treated as soon as possible, especially in remote areas. The experimental results showed the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed system. Moreover, relying on ANNs to extract the basic features, the accuracy reached 96%. The proposed system was implemented practically, and the results were displayed in real time and compared with commercial medical devices. Maximum relative errors are heart rate (2.19), body temperature (2.94), systolic blood pressure (3.4), diastolic blood pressure (2.89), and SpO2 (1.05). On the other hand, the proposed system is much faster than other wireless communication methods, regardless of the detection quality. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The proliferation of Internet-connected health devices and the widespread availability of mobile connectivity have resulted in a wealth of reliable digital health data and the potential for delivering just-in-time interventions. However, leveraging these opportunities for health research requires the development and deployment of mobile health (mHealth) applications, which present significant technical challenges for researchers. While existing mHealth solutions have made progress in addressing some of these challenges, they often fall short in terms of time-to-use, affordability, and flexibility for personalization and adaptation. ZotCare aims to address these limitations by offering ready-to-use and flexible services, providing researchers with an accessible, cost-effective, and adaptable solution for their mHealth studies. This article focuses on ZotCare’s service orchestration and highlights its capabilities in creating a programmable environment for mHealth research. Additionally, we showcase several successful research use cases that have utilized ZotCare, both in the past and in ongoing projects. Furthermore, we provide resources and information for researchers who are considering ZotCare as their mHealth research solution. 2023 Labbaf, Abbasian, Azimi, Dutt and Rahmani.

AB  - Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen's kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The use of telemonitoring solutions via wearable sensors is believed to play a major role in the prevention and therapy of physical weakening in older adults. Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis. This work may serve as a basis for the paradigm of future monitoring systems. © 2023 Abbas et al.

AB  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Due to the expanding growth of populations worldwide, infectious disease expenses are increasing rapidly. Patients with lesser chronic health problems are often encouraged to recover at home, which requires continuous remote monitoring and recommendation systems for decision-making. To overcome the above-mentioned challenges and reduce connectivity between infected patients and medical officers, we develop an artificial intelligence (AI)-based healthcare prototype in edge networks to monitor and analyze health parameters remotely. In the first phase of the work, health parameters are collected through multiple biosensors, including temperature, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation, and stored at the edge of the network. In the second phase, the monitoring data are preprocessed and analyzed using the neural network (NN) model in the edge devices for decision-making about the health status of the infected patient. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is evaluated using a real-time dataset, and multiple performance metrics are collected from the developed prototype to assess its effectiveness. The extensive simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model over the existing ML models, i.e., the NN model achieves 94.05% accuracy, which is higher than the existing ones.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Distinguishing Parkinson's disease (PD) from Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at early disease stages is important for clinical trial enrollment and clinical care/prognostication. Methods: We recruited 21 participants with PSP(n = 11) or PD(n = 10) with reliable caregivers. Standardized passage reading, counting, and sustained phonation were recorded on the BioDigit Home tablet (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA), and speech features from the assessments were analyzed using the BioDigit Speech platform (BioSensics LLC, Newton, MA USA). An independent t-test was performed to compare each speech feature between PSP and PD participants. We also performed Spearman's correlations to evaluate associations between speech measures and clinical scores (e.g., PSP rating scales and MoCA). In addition, the model's performance in classifying PSP and PD was evaluated using Rainbow passage reading analysis. Results: During Rainbow passage reading, PSP participants had a significantly slower articulation rate (2.45(0.49) vs 3.60(0.47) words/minute), lower speech-to-pause ratio (2.33(1.08) vs 3.67(1.18)), intelligibility dynamic time warping (DTW, 0.26(0.19) vs 0.53(0.26)), and similarity DTW (0.43(0.27) vs 0.67(0.13)) compared to PD participants. PSP participants also had longer pause times (17.24(5.47) vs 8.45(3.13) sec) and longer total signal times (52.44(6.67) vs (36.67(6.73) sec) when reading the passage. In terms of the phonation ‘a’, PSP participants showed a significant higher spectral entropy, spectral centroid, and spectral spread compared to PD participants and no differences were found for phonation ‘e’. PD participants had more accurate reverse number counts than PSP participants (14.89(3.86) vs 7.36(4.67)). PSP Rating Scale (PSPRS) dysarthria (r = 0.79, p = 0.004) and bulbar item scores (r = 0.803, p = 0.005) were positively correlated with articulation rate in reverse number counts. Correct reverse number counts were positively correlated with total Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (r = 0.703, p = 0.016). Machine learning models using passage reading-derived measures obtained an AUC of 0.93, and the sensitivity/specificity in correctly classifying PSP and PD participants were 0.95 and 0.90, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of differentiating PSP from PD using a digital health technology platform. Further multi-center studies are needed to expand and validate our initial findings. © 2023

AB  - Core body temperature (CBT) is a key vital sign and fever is an important indicator of disease. In the past decade, there has been growing interest for vital sign monitoring technology that may be embedded in wearable devices, and the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for remote patient monitoring systems. While wrist-worn sensors allow continuous assessment of heart rate and oxygen saturation, reliable measurement of CBT at the wrist remains challenging. In this study, CBT was measured continuously in a free-living setting using a novel technology worn at the wrist and compared to reference core body temperature measurements, i.e., CBT values acquired with an ingestible temperature-sensing pill. Fifty individuals who received the COVID-19 booster vaccination were included. The datasets of 33 individuals were used to develop the CBT prediction algorithm, and the algorithm was then validated on the datasets of 17 participants. Mean observation time was 26.4 h and CBT > 38.0 °C occurred in 66% of the participants. CBT predicted by the wrist-worn sensor showed good correlation to the reference CBT (r = 0.72). Bland–Altman statistics showed an average bias of 0.11 °C of CBT predicted by the wrist-worn device compared to reference CBT, and limits of agreement were − 0.67 to + 0.93 °C, which is comparable to the bias and limits of agreement of commonly used tympanic membrane thermometers. The small size of the components needed for this technology would allow its integration into a variety of wearable monitoring systems assessing other vital signs and at the same time allowing maximal freedom of movement to the user. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Healthcare highly depends on accessing, processing, analyzing, sharing, and storing electronic data. Cloud computing has evolved in various healthcare fields, such as bioinformatics, health management systems, and telemedicine. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), a subset of IoT, is an essential element of a healthcare management system. The expeditious development in IoMT, intelligent medical devices, healthcare applications, and high-speed networks has enabled medical systems to efficiently diagnose, treat, manage diseases, and remotely monitor and improve the Quality of Service (QoS). To achieve this high data, high speed network, longer battery life and reliable connectivity are basic requirements. 5G conformed these needs with its numerous and distinct potential. However, the shortcomings of these medical devices in the IoMT are privacy concerns and direct physical threats. We propose a new algorithm to enhance the QoS of the IoMT devices/systems. Initially, the dataset is collected and the 5G network is operationalized. We propose a Dynamic Step-wise Tiny Encryption Algorithm with Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm to encrypt data. Encrypted data is transmitted using the Energy Efficient Routing Protocol. When the user requests to access the data, the data is decrypted. We show that the proposed system has higher QoS attributes and is more effective. Our experimental results show that our proposed solution considerably improves QoS and network performance in terms of lifetime, communication overhead, storage footprint, and power consumption compared to the competing methods. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Due to their excellent mechanical properties and high tensile strain sensitivity, conductive hydrogels show great potential applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction. The integration of reliable resilience, excellent viscosity and high strain sensitivity is a great challenge for conductive hydrogels. Here, inspired by human skin with a layered structure, glycerol was first introduced into a dual-network structure to prepare a hydrogel with hydrogen bonds, endowing the hydrogels with high resilience and adhesion. A mixture of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes was sprayed on the hydrogel as a conductive layer to achieve high strain sensing. Then, a hydrogel with good toughness and high resilience was prepared by in situ polymerization as an elastic layer. Benefitting from its unique crack response mechanism, the integrated sensor showed high sensitivity (gauge factor = 20). Additionally, it presented a wide strain range (0-300%), super adhesion (56.9 N m−1) to pigskin with similar elastic modulus to the human body, and low hysteresis. This study provides a feasible solution for the improvement of wearable electronic devices for healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is capable of controlling the healthcare monitoring system for remote-based patients. Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic disturbed the smooth functioning of healthcare services throughout the world. New practices such as masking, social distancing and so on were followed to prevent the spread. Further, the severity of the problem increases for the elderly people and people having co-morbidities as proper medical care was not possible and as a result many deaths were recorded. Even for those patients who recovered from Covid could not get proper health monitoring in the Post-Covid phase as a result many deaths and severity in health conditions were reported after the Covid recovery i.e., the Post-Covid era. Technical interventions like the Internet of Things (IoT) based remote patient monitoring using Medical Internet of Things (M-IoT) wearables is one of the solutions that could help in the Post-Covid scenarios. The paper discusses a proposed framework where in a variety of IoT sensing devices along with ML algorithms are used for patient monitoring by utilizing aggregated data acquired from the registered Post-Covid patients. Thus, by using M-IoT along with Machine Learning (ML) approaches could help us in monitoring Post-Covid patients with co-morbidities for and immediate medical help. © 2023 SCPE.

Herein, we develop a type of flexible, breathable, and waterproof iontronic tactile sensor based on a nonwoven fabric platform using a facile dip-drying and solution-spraying technique. The intrinsic open-ended porous structure of the fabric offers air permeability (∼224.9 mm s-1), and the stearic acid microsheets decorated on the outside of the sensor provides effective hydrophobic protection (water contact angle ∼151.9°). The designed electrode-to-electrolyte interfacing microstructures of MXene microspheres and nanosheets on the fabric electrodes and the hierarchical structures with conical secondary features of chrysanthemum pollen on the fabric electrolyte endow the sensor with a high sensitivity of 214.92 kPa-1 and a wide detection range of 0-45 kPa. Fast response time, low detection limit, good dynamic response, and excellent stability are also achieved. With the help of a home-built mechatronic sensing system, the developed fabric tactile sensor can be practically used either as sensor units for human health status monitoring and motion detection or as a sensor array for spatial pressure distribution identification of human-object interaction. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Owing to increasing connected medical devices and rapid development of deep learning technologies, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has attracted great attention for healthcare monitoring with intelligent sensors. Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human's vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human's physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human's vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT. The FedRadar codes and constructed radar datasets are available on https://github.com/bupt-uwb/FedRadar. © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive neuromuscular disease. Its slow and variable progression makes the development of new treatments highly dependent on validated biomarkers that can quantify disease progression and response to drug interventions. Objective: We aimed to build a tool that estimates FSHD clinical severity based on behavioral features captured using smartphone and remote sensor data. The adoption of remote monitoring tools, such as smartphones and wearables, would provide a novel opportunity for continuous, passive, and objective monitoring of FSHD symptom severity outside the clinic. Methods: In total, 38 genetically confirmed patients with FSHD were enrolled. The FSHD Clinical Score and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test were used to assess FSHD symptom severity at days 0 and 42. Remote sensor data were collected using an Android smartphone, Withings Steel HR+, Body+, and BPM Connect+ for 6 continuous weeks. We created 2 single-task regression models that estimated the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG separately. Further, we built 1 multitask regression model that estimated the 2 clinical assessments simultaneously. Further, we assessed how an increasingly incremental time window affected the model performance. To do so, we trained the models on an incrementally increasing time window (from day 1 until day 14) and evaluated the predictions of the clinical severity on the remaining 4 weeks of data. Results: The single-task regression models achieved an R2 of 0.57 and 0.59 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.09 and 1.66 when estimating FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively. Time spent at a health-related location (such as a gym or hospital) and call duration were features that were predictive of both clinical assessments. The multitask model achieved an R2 of 0.66 and 0.81 and an RMSE of 1.97 and 1.61 for the FSHD Clinical Score and TUG, respectively, and therefore outperformed the single-task models in estimating clinical severity. The 3 most important features selected by the multitask model were light sleep duration, total steps per day, and mean steps per minute. Using an increasing time window (starting from day 1 to day 14) for the FSHD Clinical Score, TUG, and multitask estimation yielded an average R2 of 0.65, 0.79, and 0.76 and an average RMSE of 3.37, 2.05, and 4.37, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated that smartphone and remote sensor data could be used to estimate FSHD clinical severity and therefore complement the assessment of FSHD outside the clinic. In addition, our results illustrated that training the models on the first week of data allows for consistent and stable prediction of FSHD symptom severity. Longitudinal follow-up studies should be conducted to further validate the reliability and validity of the multitask model as a tool to monitor disease progression over a longer period. © Ahnjili Zhuparris, Ghobad Maleki, Ingrid Koopmans, Robert J Doll, Nicoline Voet, Wessel Kraaij, Adam Cohen, Emilie van Brummelen, Joris H De Maeyer, Geert Jan Groeneveld.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - In these recent years, the world has witnessed a kind of social exclusion and the inability to communicate directly due to the Corona Virus Covid 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the consequent difficulty of communicating with patients with hospitals led to the need to use modern technology to solve and facilitate the problem of people communicating with each other. healthcare has made many remarkable developments through the Internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing to monitor real-time patients’ data, which has enabled many patients’ lives to be saved. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Private Backend Server Software based on an IoT health monitoring system concerned with emergency medical services utilizing biosensors to detect multi-vital signs of an individual with an ESP32 microcontroller board and IoT cloud. The device displays the vital data, which is then uploaded to a cloud server for storage and analysis over an IoT network. Vital data is received from the cloud server and shown on the IoT medical client dashboard for remote monitoring. The proposed system allows users to ameliorate healthcare jeopardy and minify its costs by re-cording, gathering, sharing, and analyzing vast biodata streams such as Intensive Care Units (ICU) (i.e., temperature, heartbeat rate (HR), Oxygen level (SPO2), etc.), efficiently in real-time. In this proposal, the data is sent from sensors fixed in the patient body to the Web and Mobile App continually in real time for collection and analysis. The system showed impressive performance with an average disparity of less than 1%. body temperature, SPO2, and HR readings were remarkably accurate compared to the CE approval patient monitoring system. In Addition, The system was highly dependable with a success rate for IoT data broadcasts. © 2023,International journal of online and biomedical engineering. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents a hazardous cardiac arrhythmia that significantly elevates the risk of stroke and heart failure. Despite its severity, its diagnosis largely relies on the proficiency of health care professionals. At present, the real-time identification of paroxysmal AF is hindered by the lack of automated techniques. Consequently, a highly effective machine learning algorithm specifically designed for AF detection could offer substantial clinical benefits. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms have the potential to identify and extract features of AF with a high degree of accuracy, given the intricate and distinctive patterns present in electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of AF. Objective: This study aims to develop a clinically valuable machine learning algorithm that can accurately detect AF and compare different leads’ performances of AF detection. Methods: We used 12-lead ECG recordings sourced from the 2020 PhysioNet Challenge data sets. The Welch method was used to extract power spectral features of the 12-lead ECGs within a frequency range of 0.083 to 24.92 Hz. Subsequently, various machine learning techniques were evaluated and optimized to classify sinus rhythm (SR) and AF based on these power spectral features. Furthermore, we compared the effects of different frequency subbands and different lead selections on machine learning performances. Results: The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) was found to be the most effective in classifying AF and SR, achieving an average F1-score of 0.988 across all ECG leads. Among the frequency subbands, the 0.083 to 4.92 Hz range yielded the highest F1-score of 0.985. In interlead comparisons, aVR had the highest performance (F1=0.993), with minimal differences observed between leads. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study successfully used machine learning methodologies, particularly the LightGBM model, to differentiate SR and AF based on power spectral features derived from 12-lead ECGs. The performance marked by an average F1-score of 0.988 and minimal interlead variation underscores the potential of machine learning algorithms to bolster real-time AF detection. This advancement could significantly improve patient care in intensive care units as well as facilitate remote monitoring through wearable devices, ultimately enhancing clinical outcomes. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

AB  - Flexible strain sensors have attracted great interest in many fields, including wearable devices, healthcare monitoring, and electronic skin. However, their non-linearity and tardy response time severely influence their sensing precision, and their low toughness, inferior environmental adaptation and non-recyclability are bad for their durability and unfavorable for electronic waste management. Here, we designed and synthesized a wide linear range and fast response strain sensor based on ionic conductive hydrogels (PVA-CS-PA hydrogels) using biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CS) as the polymer backbone, and biogenic phytic acid (PA) as the crosslinker. PVA-CS-PA hydrogels are tough and ductile. The hydrogel with a volume ratio of 3 : 2 for PA : H2O (PVA-CS-3PA-2 hydrogel), had a stretchability of 915 ± 32.44%, strength of 6.02 ± 0.18 MPa, and fracture energy of 5.28 ± 0.24 kJ m−2. It was also thermoplastic and anti-drying (more than 90% water retention after 30 days). The hydrogel-based strain sensor displayed a wide linear working range up to 900% strain, a fast response time within 50 ms, and reliable stability to detect subtle and large motions. Moreover, its sensing performance is maintained well after a thermoplastic process and long-term storage, suggesting it has reusability and a long lifetime. This tough, wide linear range, fast response, green, and recyclable hydrogel-based strain sensor is expected to pave the way for the development of environmentally friendly and high-performance artificial intelligence in versatile electronic applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Recently, deep learning and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been widely used in the healthcare monitoring system for decision making. Disease prediction is one of the emerging applications in current practices. In the method described in this paper, lung cancer prediction is implemented using deep learning and IoT, which is a challenging task in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). Because lung cancer is a dangerous medical disease that must be identified at a higher detection rate, disease-related information is obtained from IoT medical devices and transmitted to the server. The medical data are then processed and classified into two categories, benign and malignant, using a multi-layer CNN (ML-CNN) model. In addition, a particle swarm optimization method is used to improve the learning ability (loss and accuracy). This step uses medical data (CT scan and sensor information) based on the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). For this purpose, sensor information and image information from IoMT devices and sensors are gathered, and then classification actions are taken. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with well-known existing methods, such as the Support Vector Machine (SVM), probabilistic neural network (PNN), and conventional CNN, in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, F-score, and computation time. For this purpose, two lung datasets were tested to evaluate the performance: Lung Image Database Consortium (LIDC) and Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS) datasets. Compared to alternative methods, the trial outcomes showed that the suggested technique has the potential to help the radiologist make an accurate and efficient early lung cancer diagnosis. The performance of the proposed ML-CNN was analyzed using Python, where the accuracy (2.5–10.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, precision (2.3–9.5%) was high when compared to the number of instances, sensitivity (2.4–12.5%) was high when compared to several instances, the F-score (2–30%) was high when compared to the number of cases, the error rate (0.7–11.5%) was low compared to the number of cases, and the computation time (170 ms to 400 ms) was low compared to how many cases were computed for the proposed work, including previous known methods. The proposed ML-CNN architecture shows that this technique outperforms previous works. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The convergence of Internet-based technology with primary care utility is critical for the worldwide amalgamation of quality medical management and its accessibility. Innovation has remained a significant aspect of medical care, allowing physicians to employ a variety of instruments to examine, administer, and observe patients. This paper’s central emphasis is on e-health data collection, conveyance, and surveillance apparatus. The wireless monitoring system monitors patients’ medical metrics and communicates them to the furthest edge via the ZigBee gateway. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled smart e-healthcare system that can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and the real-time room environment where patients are currently positioned. This system collects data from the hospital premises using five sensors: the body temperature sensor, the heartbeat sensor, the room temperature sensor, the CO2 sensor, and the CO sensor. For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately. The data for heart rate and body temperature is analyzed using the bio-medical sensors embedded with an ARM Cortex-A7 microcontroller. For the benchmark accuracy of the dataset, a detailed calculation of experiments in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with various machine learning techniques is compared. It has been exemplified through extensive testing that the recommended procedure outperforms machine learning methodologies with a 15% increase in accuracy, facilitating rapid alarms to prevent the aftereffects of abnormalities if they occur, which the system without the utilized methodology lags. Cloud storage allows for the analysis of parameters regarding patients. The error between observed and actual data is analyzed to validate the proposed Internet of Medical Things model. The performance of the proposed method is further identified by using various classifications, like decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes, for detecting any variation from normal data or disorder on real-time datasets. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients' needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals' behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients' behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Sleep problems are serious issues that make life difficult for all people, including sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, which causes breathlessness for more than 10 s, is linked to severe health problems due to the serious damage it can induce. To mitigate the risk of these disorders, the monitoring of patients has become increasingly challenging. Wearable technologies offer an effective healthcare solution for remote patient monitoring and diagnosis. A novel wearable system based on Arduino technology is introduced, specifically designed to monitor the breath patterns of patients. The analysis of breath data from patients holds great importance for the diagnosis and continuous monitoring of sleep apnea. To address this need, an advanced image processing system based on deep learning techniques is presented. This system automatically detects respiratory patterns, including inhalation, exhalation, and breathlessness. The device has an average of 97.6% sensitivity, 79.7% specificity, and 96% accuracy in identifying breath patterns. The designed device can offer patients and healthcare institutions a simple, inexpensive, noninvasive, and ergonomic system for the analysis of breath patterns that can be further extended for sleep apnea diagnosis. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Aggression in children is highly prevalent and can have devastating consequences, yet there is currently no objective method to track its frequency in daily life. This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The transformation of traditional hospitals to a smart healthcare system is a patient-centric, reliable, and smarter way to enhance healthcare facilities for individuals. These healthcare devices are based on the Internet of Things (IoT) and conventional network structures such as 3rd generation (3G) or 4th generation (4G). That did not provide the patient health data in the real-time scenario. Therefore, the integrated 5G-IoT system offers distinct benefits such as remote monitoring, surgery, and real-time data analysis of healthcare system that is operated with slice of dedicated network. It generates huge data with the billions of healthcare equipment that can be evaluated for decision making. This enormous data requires low latency, high-security, capacity, and more reliable techniques for evaluation. In this scenario, network slicing is one of the key solutions that can be considered for isolated end-to-end network structures. Network slicing enables logical and independent network virtual networks to be multiplexed for the same physical network. In this article, we propose an intelligent approach for network resource optimization and analysis of a 5G-IoT based smart healthcare network. We examine the performance of the machine learning algorithm by an automatic model, named A Fast Library for automated machine learning (FLAML). In addition, we perform network slicing to obtain resource optimization in 5G-IoT-based healthcare application. © 2023 by author(s).

AB  - The field of wireless sensor networks has grown significantly due to notable research contributions in the domain of wireless networks and semiconductors. It has been noted in the recent past that WBANs significantly support a range of pervasive medical and healthcare applications. A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a task-oriented, self-organising sensor network and is an interconnection of a multitude of biomarker sensors and medical diagnostic gadgets. These backbone nodes may be embedded in the human body or planted on the human body. In this paper, we proposed a secured WBAN-based system for healthcare facilities. This model will help patients and medical professionals monitor the health of patients at any time despite their physical presence. It also discusses the utilisation of a machine learning based cloud system which keeps learning from new data sets and remains updated about new symptoms.

To make the collected biological data understandable and improve the efficacy of these biosensors, scientists have integrated machine learning (ML) with biosensors to analyze large sensing data through various ML algorithms. In this article, we have highlighted the recent developments in ML-enabled noninvasive biosensors. Initially, we introduced and discussed the basic features of ML algorithms used in data processing to build an intelligent biosensor system and the capability to make clinical decisions. Next, the principles of portable and wearable biosensors, the application of different ML models in diverse biosensors for healthcare applications, and their impact on the performance of biosensors are discussed. The last section highlights the challenges (such as data privacy, consistency, stability, accuracy, scalable production, and adaptive learning capacity), future prospects, and necessary steps required to address these issues, spotlighting their revolutionizing impact on the healthcare industry for the development of next-generation ML-enabled efficient biosensors. © 2023

AB  - Presently Every nation places a high value on healthcare due to the rise in trauma instances. The ideal approach in this case is thought to be an Internet of Things (IoT) based health monitoring system. A novel approach in internet technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasing study area, mainly in the field of healthcare. The rising use of wearable sensors and cellphones has allowed these remote health care monitoring systems to grow at such a rapid rate. IoT health monitoring helps patients receive the appropriate care for their present level of health even when a physician is far away. The notion of the IoT and deep learning are combined in this study to present a systematic method to identify trauma instances more effectively. By utilizing some of the biological information from the patient's body, such as temperature, heart rate, and other factors, this approach presents an overview of the IoT and is also used to monitor health status and identify symptoms in the human body. For fall detection using sensor nodes, the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) analyses individuals' motion and architecture. The suggested method may be put in place for less money but has significant potential to identify symptoms by giving patients and suspected cases the care they need and reacting to life-or-death circumstances. Metrics such as precision, recall, F-measure, and accuracy are utilized to evaluate the results when applying classification algorithms. When compared to techniques like the Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and K Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), the findings show that it has been very successful. © 2023

AB  - Flexible capacitive pressure sensors as one of the crucial sensing components have aroused widespread concern because of their vital role in development of wearable artificial devices, healthcare biomonitoring and human-machine interface. However, there has been a considerable challenge to successfully fabricate them with a tradeoff between high sensitivity and wide sensing range by low-cost and convenient manufacturing methods. Herein, the orientated thermoplastic polyurethane elastomer rubber nanofiber membranes (TPU-O NMs) were prepared via conjugated electrospinning to build a dielectric layer for the flexible capacitive wide-range pressure sensors with high sensitivity. In addition, polyaniline (PANI) was in situ polymerized on the TPU-O NMs as flexible electrodes to maintain the conductive pathway, flexibility, and breathability of the sensors. The TPU@PANI NMs form a bamboo-raft-like microstructure between the aligned fibers under pressure, resulting in a significant increase in sensitivity and working range. Furthermore, the conductive TPU@PANI NMs can be stretched to 1600% without fracture. The assembled sensor has a high sensitivity of 31.73 kPa−1 and a fast response/recovery time of 96 ms. Meantime, it also exhibits a minimum detection limit of 1 Pa, an excellent stability of 10,000 cycles, and a good linearity in a broad working age (1 Pa∼122.5 kPa). Finally, the capacitive pressure sensor was successfully applied for full-range detection of human motions, such as finger bending, joint bending, and even boxing movements. Hence this highly sensitive and wide-range pressure sensor can be a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring, motion recognition, and wearable circuitry in artificial intelligence. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences. © 2023 Htet Yamin Ko Ko et al.

AB  - In this article, an assistive technology in the form of a stress monitoring system customized exclusively for people affected by autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is proposed. ASD tends to impact the linguistic and motor skills and the effects of stress often has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of the individuals. The suppressed heart rate variability (HRV) is found to be lesser in ASD affected individuals. This is considered as a key factor and the constraints of the parameters to be monitored such as heart rate, body temperature and body movements is set accordingly. The hardware module encompasses various sensors such as pulse sensor, temperature sensor and accelerometers and can be developed into a variety of wearables specific to the user. The acquired data is transmitted to a non-relational database whose data is extracted and processed by a machine learning model consisting of a linear regression algorithm and random forest classifier algorithm to generate and analyse reports to support the mental stress management of the user. This wearable device can be accommodated for remote monitoring of the users in mundane day to day situations and even in social habitats such as healthcare establishments and even in educational institutions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management.

AB  - The dramatic progresses of wireless technologies and wearable devices have significantly promoted the development and popularity of smart home, while digital twin (DT) emerges as a game changer benefiting from its enhanced capabilities of visualization and interaction. The DT is able to build a realtime and continuous visual replica of a physical object or process, and to provide realtime monitoring, anomaly prediction, smart interaction, and lifecycle management. This paper presents a DT model to empower healthcare monitoring in the smart home with the goals of graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. High fidelity DT of the house and its equipments is created for visualized monitoring, and two suites of devices are deployed for continuously acquiring the users' electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals in the house. Two intelligent algorithms are then developed to perform fall detection from WiFi signals and to screen atrial fibrillation from ECG waves collected by wearable devices. Experimental results well validate the proposed model's effectiveness for smart home monitoring, and the advantages of the developed smart algorithms for healthcare prediction over counterparts.  © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent neurological disorder that necessitates using objective and non-invasive methods for assessing symptom severity. Traditional visual assessments are often limited by subjectivity, while other wearable sensors or visual markers may result in unnatural movements. This study presents a novel contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment that integrates refined whole-body pose estimation with Transformer-based tremor detection to quantify tremor severity at a fine-grained level. The proposed pose estimation method combines the Transformer with HRNet, effectively capturing spatial-temporal complementary information from multiple body parts and enabling highly accurate tremor detection. The Transformer-based tremor detection is well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies and sequential tremor data extracted by the pose estimation model, further improving the performance of our proposed method. Our study collected data from 61 patients with ET, achieving an average accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 95.6%/95.6%, 89.2%/95.0%, and 83.0%/92.4% for classifying ET severity both during rest and postural tasks, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms the temporal convolutional network baseline, increasing F1 scores by 21.17% and 14.22% for rest and postural tasks, respectively. This high level of accuracy makes our method highly useful for clinical applications such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation. Our proposed technique has many advantages over traditional ET assessment techniques, including non-invasiveness, contact-free operation, and not requiring any wearable sensors or visual markers. Moreover, our method can be applied to other movement disorders requiring objective measurements of symptom severity. In summary, our contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment represents a significant improvement over traditional ET assessment techniques, and our quantification results demonstrate its potential for use in clinical settings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The rising use of mobile technology and smart gadgets in the field of health has had a significant impact on the global community. Health professionals are increasingly making use of the benefits of these technologies, resulting in a major improvement in health care both in and out of clinical settings. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new internet revolution that is a rising research area, particularly in health care. Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HMS) have progressed rapidly as the usage of Wearable Sensors (WS) and smartphones have increased. The existing framework of conventional telemedicine's store-and-forward method has some issues, including the need for a nearby health centre with dedicated employees and medical devices to prepare patient reports. Patients' health can be continuously monitored using advanced WS that can be fitted or embedded in their bodies. This research proposes an innovative and smart HMS, which is built using recent technologies such as the IoT and Machine Learning (ML). In this study, we present an innovative and intelligent HMS based on cutting-edge technologies such as the IoT and Deep Learning (DL) + Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). This DL + RBM model is clever enough to detect and process a patient's data using a medical Decision Support System (DSS) to determine whether the patient is suffering from a major health problem and treat it accordingly. The recommended system's behavior is increasingly investigated using a cross-validation test that determines various demographically relevant standard measures. Through a healthcare DSS, this framework is clever enough to detect and analyze a patient's data. Experiment results further reveal that the proposed system is efficient and clever enough to deliver health care. The data reported in this study demonstrate the notion. This device is a low-cost solution for people living in distant places; anyone can use it to determine if they have a major health problem and seek treatment by contacting nearby hospitals. © 2023 CRL Publishing.

AB  - Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - With the rise of artificial intelligence, sensor-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) is increasingly being employed in healthcare monitoring for the elderly, fitness tracking, and patient rehabilitation using smart devices. Inertial sensors have been commonly used for S-HAR, but wearable devices have been demanding more comfort and flexibility in recent years. Consequently, there has been an effort to incorporate stretch sensors into S-HAR with the advancement of flexible electronics technology. This paper presents a deep learning network model, utilizing aggregation residual transformation, that can efficiently extract spatial–temporal features and perform activity classification. The efficacy of the suggested model was assessed using the w-HAR dataset, which included both inertial and stretch sensor data. This dataset was used to train and test five fundamental deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BiGRU), along with the proposed model. The primary objective of the w-HAR investigations was to determine the feasibility of utilizing stretch sensors for recognizing human actions. Additionally, this study aimed to explore the effectiveness of combining data from both inertial and stretch sensors in S-HAR. The results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing HAR using inertial and stretch sensors. The deep learning model we presented achieved an impressive accuracy of 97.68%. Notably, our method outperformed existing approaches and demonstrated excellent generalization capabilities. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Apomorphine, a potent dopamine agonist, is a therapeutic option for patients with Parkinson’s disease and motor fluctuations. However, the adoption of and adherence to this therapy have been limited by the need for complex delivery devices and specialized care as well as resource consumption, posing challenges for new physicians. Thailand is a unique example of a developing nation that has successfully implemented and continued the use of this therapy by employing cooperative technology that has dramatically enhanced apomorphine delivery services. Methods: Establishing apomorphine delivery services requires significant resources and step-by-step solutions. We began our services by implementing various strategies in three chronological stages: the initial stage (2013–2015), intermediate stage (2016–2019), and current stage (2020–present), each presenting unique challenges. Together, we also implemented a proposed set of five mottos to strengthen our apomorphine delivery service. Using additive technology, we developed a patient registry platform that combined electronic data acquisition, video and remote monitoring using wearable sensors, and in-house mobile applications to support our service. Results: At the initial stage, we assembled a team to enhance the efficacy and confirm the safety of apomorphine treatment in our hospital. At the intermediate stage, we expanded our apomorphine delivery services beyond just the patients at our hospital. We supported other hospitals in Thailand in setting up their own apomorphine services by educating both physicians and nurses regarding apomorphine therapy. With this educational undertaking, increased apomorphine-related knowledge among medical professionals, and a greater number of hospitals providing apomorphine services, an increasing number of patients were administered apomorphine in subsequent years. Currently, we are providing effective apomorphine delivery to improve patient outcomes and are seamlessly integrating technology into clinical practice. Incorporating integrative technologies in our apomorphine delivery program yielded positive results in data collection and support throughout patient care, in tracking patients’ statuses, in the long-term use of this treatment, and in increasing medication adherence rates. Conclusion: This perspective paper describes how technology can help provide supportive healthcare services in resource-constrained environments, such as in Thailand, offering a step-by-step approach to overcoming several limitations. The valuable insights from our 10-year journey in successfully integrating technology into apomorphine delivery services can benefit new physicians seeking to replicate our success.

AB  - Many stroke survivors experience persistent upper extremity impairment that limits performance in activities of daily living. Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors’ task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - The framework presented in this article provides a guide for designing secure and sustainable internet of medical things (IoMT) solutions. The main objective is to address the challenges related to safety and sustainability in the medical field. The critical conditions driving these challenges are identified, and future trends in the field of IoMT are discussed. To assess the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a case study was carried out in a private medical clinic. In this study, an IoMT system was implemented to monitor patients’ vital signs, even when they were not in the clinic. The positive results demonstrated that the implemented IoMT system met the established security and sustainability requirements. The main statistical findings of the case study include the real-time monitoring of the vital signs of the patients, which improved the quality of care and allowed for the early detection of possible complications. In addition, medical devices such as the blood pressure monitor, pulse oximeter, and electrocardiograph were selected, proving safe, durable, and energy and maintenance efficient. These results were consistent with previous research that had shown the benefits of IoMT in remote monitoring, the early detection of health problems, and improved medical decision-making. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The advancement in automation and medical care technologies in recent decade has changed the traditional medical treatment of patients. Although, these technologies have increased the treatment's precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are needed in high-performance piezoresistive sensors due to their strong strain-induced bandgap modification and thereby large gauge factors. However, integrating a conventional high-temperature chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown TMD with a flexible substrate necessitates a transfer process that inevitably degrades the sensing properties of the TMDs and increases the overall fabrication complexity. We present a high-performance piezoresistive strain sensor that employs large-area PdSe2 films grown directly on polyimide (PI) substrates via plasma-assisted selenization of a sputtered Pd film. The reliable strain transfer from the substrate to the PdSe2 film ensures an outstanding strain-sensing capability of the sensor. Specifically, the sensors have a gauge factor of up to −315 ± 2.1, a response time under 25 ms, a detection limit of 8 × 10−6, and an exceptional stability of over 104 loading–unloading cycles. By attaching the sensors to the skin surface, we demonstrate their application for measuring physiological parameters in health care monitoring, including motion, voice, and arterial pulse vibration. Furthermore, using the PdSe2 film sensor combined with deep learning technology, we achieved intelligent recognition of artery temperature from arterial pulse signals with only a 2% difference between predicted and actual temperatures. The excellent sensing performance, together with the advantages of low-temperature fabrication and simple device structure, make the PdSe2 film sensor promising for wearable electronics and health care sensing systems.

AB  - Respiratory rate (RR) is an important biomarker as RR changes can reflect severe medical events, such as heart disease, lung disease, and sleep disorders. Unfortunately, standard manual RR counting is prone to human error and cannot be performed continuously. This study proposes a method for continuously estimating RR, RRWaveNet. The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%. This shows that this model allows accurate and practical estimation of RR on affordable and wearable devices. Our study also shows feasibility of remote RR monitoring in the context of telemedicine and at home.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The need for remote healthcare monitoring systems that utilize limited resources' biosensors is growing. These biosensors increase the amount of transmitted data across the Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHT) network. Therefore, it is necessary to decrease the transmitted data and make a decision at the edge gateway to save the energy of the biosensors and produce a quick response for the medical staff. This paper proposes an energy-efficient multisensor adaptive sampling and aggregation (EMASA) for patient monitoring in edge computing-based IoHT networks. In the edge-based IoHT network, EMASA operates on two levels: biosensors and the edge gateway. Each biosensor removes the redundant sensed data using the local emergency detection and sampling rate adaptation algorithms. In the edge gateway, it implements a machine learning-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to provide a suitable decision about the status of the monitored patient. We accomplished various examinations using real data from the patients' biosensors. According to the simulation results, EMASA reduced the size of transmitted data from 93.5% to 99% and saved 78.35% of energy when compared to a previous study. It keeps the whole score with a good representation at the Edge gateway and provides accurate and fast decisions based on the patient's condition. © 2023-IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid advancement in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and wireless networking technologies has ushered in a new era for healthcare, particularly in the domain of smart health monitoring for elderly populations. This paper explores the development and implementation of a state-of-the-art cyber-physical wireless network system designed to enhance the health monitoring of elderly individuals, thereby improving their quality of life and enabling independent living. By leveraging the interconnectivity of CPS within a 6G wireless network framework, our proposed system facilitates real-time health monitoring and emergency response through the seamless integration of wearable health sensors, mobile devices, and cloud computing services. The core of our system architecture is built on robust wireless communication protocols that ensure reliable data transmission from wearable sensors to the central monitoring system. This paper introduces a digital twin (DT)-based model designed to enhance healthcare monitoring within smart homes, aiming at graphical monitoring, healthcare prediction, and intelligent control. A high-fidelity DT of the home and its equipment is developed for visual monitoring purposes, and two sets of devices are utilised to continually gather users’ electrocardiograph (ECG) waves and the WiFi signals within the home. Furthermore, two advanced deep learning algorithms are proposed for detecting falls using WiFi signals and identifying atrial fibrillation from ECG waves recorded by wearable devices. The effectiveness of the proposed model for smart home monitoring is confirmed through experimental results, showcasing the superiority of the developed intelligent algorithms in healthcare prediction compared to existing solutions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - In social IoMT systems, resource-constrained devices face the challenges of limited computation, bandwidth, and privacy in the deployment of deep learning models. Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive technique for recording human vital signs. PPG is normally recorded by wearable devices that are prone to artifacts. This results in signal corruption that decreases measurement accuracy. Thus, a signal quality assessment (SQA) system is essential in obtaining reliable measurements. Conventionally, SQA is mainly driven by human-knowledge and supervised through experts' annotations. However, they are not tailored for the particularities of the domain applications. Hence, we propose a machine-aided SQA framework that generates respective quality criteria for applications. By using the proposed approach, quality criteria can be easily trained for different applications. Then, quality assessment can be applied to several PPG-based physiological signals telemonitoring. Compared with conventional approaches, the proposed system has a higher rejection rate for high-error signals and a lower mean absolute error is achieved when estimating heart rate (-3.06 BPM), determining respiration rate (-1.36 BPM), and predicting hypertension (+24%). The proposed method enhances accuracy in monitoring physiological signals and thus is suitable for healthcare applications.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), its communication and information enabling technologies are revolutionizing the production and services applications. In the healthcare domain, electronic health (eHealth) is evolving towards healthcare 4.0 through the Internet of things, big data analytics, Cloud and Fog computing technologies. There is need for early cancer detection, which can be achieved by new imaging technologies for example Terahertz imaging and Infrared thermography. The integration of such new imaging modalities and wearable sensor networks with computer aided diagnosis systems (CAD) and IoT systems with interconnectivity and interoperability could enable continuous, remote observation of cancer diagnosed patients by experts to monitor the success of treatment procedures, side effects of drugs, statistical analysis and making predictions of cancer based on age and demographics etc. for timely intervention and personalized care. In the healthcare 4.0 paradigm, there is need not only for smart diagnosis but also care through remote patient monitoring. The vital signs associated with cancer and clinical information can be integrated to make the system culminate into a smart system with health records. This work proposes an IoT enabled deep learning framework for classification of breast images; we propose the development of both custom CNN model and fine-tuned, pretrained CNN models capable of multimodal image classification. IoT simulation and cloud processing is performed in the ThingSpeak cloud platform with email alert capability. The performance of the CNN models has been evaluated using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics which achieved 98.44%, 98.44% and 98.45% respectively for the custom CNN model together with the receiver operating characteristics curves and confusion matrices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective. Physiological sensor data (e.g. photoplethysmograph) is important for remotely monitoring patients’ vital signals, but is often affected by measurement noise. Existing feature-based models for signal cleaning can be limited as they might not capture the full signal characteristics. Approach. In this work we present a deep learning framework for sensor signal cleaning based on dilated convolutions which capture the coarse- and fine-grained structure in order to classify whether a signal is noisy or clean. However, since obtaining annotated physiological data is costly and time-consuming we propose an autoencoder-based semi-supervised model which is able to learn a representation of the sensor signal characteristics, also adding an element of interpretability. Main results. Our proposed models are over 8% more accurate than existing feature-based approaches with half the false positive/negative rates. Finally, we show that with careful tuning (that can be improved further), the semi-supervised model outperforms supervised approaches suggesting that incorporating the large amounts of available unlabeled data can be advantageous for achieving high accuracy (over 90%) and minimizing the false positive/negative rates. Significance. Our approach enables us to reliably separate clean from noisy physiological sensor signal that can pave the development of reliable features and eventually support decisions regarding drug efficacy in clinical trials. © 2023The Author(s).

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been proven to be effective in various healthcare and telemonitoring applications. Current HAR methods, especially deep learning, are extensively employed owing to their exceptional recognition capabilities. However, in pursuit of enhancing feature expression abilities, deep learning often introduces a trade-off by increasing Time complexity. Moreover, the intricate nature of human activity data poses a challenge as it can lead to a notable decrease in recognition accuracy when affected by additional noise. These aspects will significantly impair recognition performance. To advance this field further, we present a HAR method based on an edge-computing-assisted and GRU deep-learning network. We initially proposed a model for edge computing to optimize the energy consumption and processing time of wearable devices. This model transmits HAR data to edge-computable nodes, deploys analytical models on edge servers for remote training, and returns results to wearable devices for processing. Then, we introduced an initial convolution method to preprocess large amounts of training data more effectively. To this end, an attention mechanism was integrated into the network structure to enhance the analysis of confusing data and improve the accuracy of action classification. Our results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved an average accuracy of 85.4% on the 200 difficult-to-identify HAR data, which outperforms the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method’s accuracy of 77.1%. The experimental results showcase the efficacy of the proposed method and offer valuable insights for the future application of HAR. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient’s cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - To develop intelligent wearable protection systems is of great significance to human health engineering. An ideal intelligent air filtration system should possess reliable filtration efficiency, low pressure drop, healthcare monitoring function, and man-machine interactive capability. However, no existing intelligent protection system covers all these essential aspects. Herein, we developed an intelligent wearable filtration system (IWFS) via advanced nanotechnology and machine learning. Based on the triboelectric mechanism, the fabricated IWFS exhibits a long-lasting high particle filtration efficiency and bacteria protection efficiency of 99% and 100%, respectively, with a low-pressure drop of 5.8 mmH2O. Correspondingly, the charge accumulation of the optimized IWFS (87 nC) increased to 3.5 times that of the pristine nanomesh, providing a significant enhancement of the particle filtration efficiency. Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices. The achieved IWFS not only has practical significance for human health management but also has great theoretical value for advanced wearable systems. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - Considering the increasing growth of communicable diseases worldwide such as COVID-19, it is recommended to stay at home for patients with fewer chronic health problems. In recent times, the high chance of COVID-19 spread and the lack of an excellent remote monitoring system make the situation challenging for hospital administrators. Inspired by these challenges, in this paper, we develop a new edge-centric healthcare framework for remote health monitoring and disease prediction using Wearable Sensors (WSs) and advanced Machine Learning (ML) model, namely Bag-of-Neural Network (BoNN), respectively. The epidemic model collects the health symptoms of the patient using various a set of WSs and preprocesses the data in distributed edge devices for preparing a useful dataset. Finally, the proposed BoNN model is applied over the refined dataset for detecting COVID-19 disease at centralized cloud servers using a set of random neural networks. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed BoNN model over the standard ML models, the system is fine-tuned and trained over a synthetic COVID-19 dataset before being evaluated on a benchmark Brazil COVID-19 dataset using various performance metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BoNN model achieves 99.8% accuracy while analyzing the Brazil dataset. © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Microalgal biotechnology holds the potential for renewable biofuels, bioproducts, and carbon capture applications due to unparalleled photosynthetic efficiency and diversity. Outdoor open raceway pond (ORP) cultivation enables utilization of sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide to drive microalgal biomass synthesis for production of bioproducts including biofuels; however, environmental conditions are highly dynamic and fluctuate both diurnally and seasonally, making ORP productivity prediction challenging without time-intensive physical measurements and location-specific calibrations. Here, for the first time, we present an image-based deep learning method for the prediction of ORP productivity. Our method is based on parameter profile plot images of sensor parameters, including pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, photosynthetically active radiation, and total dissolved solids. These parameters can be remotely monitored without physical interaction with ORPs. We apply the model to data we generated during the Unified Field Studies of the Algae Testbed Public-Private-Partnership (ATP3 UFS), the largest publicly available ORP data set to date, which includes millions of sensor records and 598 productivities from 32 ORPs operated in 5 states in the United States. We demonstrate that this approach significantly outperforms an average value based traditional machine learning method (R2 = 0.77 ≫ R2 = 0.39) without considering bioprocess parameters (e.g., biomass density, hydraulic retention time, and nutrient concentrations). We then evaluate the sensitivity of image and monitoring data resolutions and input parameter variations. Our results demonstrate ORP productivity can be effectively predicted from remote monitoring data, providing an inexpensive tool for microalgal production and operational forecasting. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - One of the most cutting-edge technologies over the years is the Internet of Things (IoT), which is a major force behind the paradigm shift away from conventional medical practises. The goal of IoT-based eHealth is to provide healthcare services that are more effective and individualised through continuous data exchange between linked devices and enhanced data analytics. The IoT and decision-making systems are the main areas of focus of this programme, which seeks to deliver intelligent and proactive healthcare. By considering the huge array of physiological characteristics and applying potent analytical tools like cluster analysis, it is possible to obtain more insight into health-data. In this study, e-health technologies and remote patient monitoring were developed to assist patients in avoiding hospital visits, especially during viral epidemics. This project will use IoT and artificial intelligence (AI) technology to address these problems. The study's objective is to select the most appropriate and effective number of hidden layers and activation function types for the deep net (NN). Describe the patient data sent using IoT protocols next. NN analyses the information from the patient's medical sensors to choose the optimal option. The diagnosis is then communicated to the physician. The proposed technology enables patients to autonomously recognise and forecast the sickness while also supporting clinicians in remote disease discovery and analysis without requiring patients to attend the hospital. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Recently, human healthcare from body sensor data has gained considerable interest from a wide variety of human-computer communication and pattern analysis research owing to their real-time applications namely smart healthcare systems. Even though there are various forms of utilizing distributed sensors to monitor the behavior of people and vital signs, physical human action recognition (HAR) through body sensors gives useful information about the lifestyle and functionality of an individual. This article concentrates on the design of an Improved Transient Search Optimization with Machine Learning based Behavior Recognition (ITSOML-BR) technique using body sensor data. The presented ITSOML-BR technique collects data from different body sensors namely electrocardiography (ECG), accelerometer, and magnetometer. In addition, the ITSOML-BR technique extract features like variance, mean, skewness, and standard deviation. Moreover, the presented ITSOML-BR technique executes a micro neural network (MNN) which can be employed for long term healthcare monitoring and classification. Furthermore, the parameters related to the MNN model are optimally selected via the ITSO algorithm. The experimental result analysis of the ITSOML-BR technique is tested on the MHEALTH dataset. The comprehensive comparison study reported a higher result for the ITSOML-BR approach over other existing approaches with maximum accuracy of 99.60%. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this work, we propose SemBox - Semantic interoperability in a Box, to enable wireless on-the-go communication between heterogeneous wearable health monitoring devices. It can connect wirelessly to the health monitoring devices and receive their data packets. It uses a Mamdani-based fuzzy inference system with data pre-processing to classify the received data packet into one of the classes of the vital parameters. It enables semantic interoperability by labelling and annotating the data packets based on the extracted packet information. We implement SemBox using three different health monitoring wearables, with different keywords used for each vital parameter representation in the data packet. SemBox shows a maximum classification accuracy of 85.71%, with a maximum PDR of 1 at the SemBox with varying device parameters. Overall, SemBox is a potential plug-and-play solution to achieve semantic interoperability and collaboration between heterogeneous health monitoring wearable devices, irrespective of their commercial and proprietary specifications. It is customizable for applications that use multiple heterogeneous devices for collaborative monitoring and decision support. SemBox enables interoperability among health monitoring devices, introduces flexibility and ease the inter-device dynamics in the domain of biomedical research.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Pressure sensors with high flexibility and sensitivity face significant challenges in meeting the delicate balance and synergy among suitable active sensing electrode materials, substrates, and their device geometry design. In this contribution, layer-engineered delaminated Ti-MXene (DL-Ti3C2Tx) is introduced, which has relatively wider interlayer spacing through intercalated large organic molecules and accordion-like open internal microstructure than the narrower pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti-MXene), graphene/carbon nanotube's interlayer spacing suitably fulfill the high sensitivity and flexibility requirement through accessible electronic pathways under the external pressure. Notably, a milder in-situ ambient condition etching is performed to eliminate the associated safety risks for a flexible personal healthcare monitoring pressure sensor. DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene-empowered, flexible pressure sensor demonstrates a broad range of sensitivities up to a very high-pressure of 20.8 kPa at a sensitivity of 242.3 kPa−1 with a fast response and recovery time (<300 ms). A twofold increase in pressure sensitivity performance of DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene than that of Ti-MXene, graphene can be attributed to the engineered wider interlayer distance among the delaminated DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene layers causing a facile interlayer atomic movements, contacts, and reversible compressibility. The current economical, scalable DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene flexible pressure sensor can provide future safe personal healthcare artificial intelligence with real-time tracking ability. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The rise in chronic diseases and the aging of the population led to an increase in the demand for remote healthcare systems that employ biosensors to monitor people's health status. The increasing need for these automated systems has led to the emergence of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) networks. In the IoMT networks, the biosensor devices collect vital signs and transmit them to the gateway for further analysis and fusion. In light of the limited biosensor device resources (power, storage, and computation) and the periodical transmission of a large amount of data, it is necessary to optimize the transmission of data in order to conserve power while maintaining data quality at the gateway. Also, it became important to have a decision-making-based machine learning model at the gateway to evaluate a patient's health and make a quick, accurate decision in case of an emergency. This article proposes multibiosensor data sampling and transmission reduction with decision-making (MuDaSaTReD) for remote patient monitoring in the IoMT networks. The MuDaSaTReD achieves this goal on two levels: biosensors and a fog gateway. It uses an energy-saving lightweight data transmission (ELiDaT) algorithm to get rid of the repeated data and then adapts the sampling rate of each biosensor using an adaptive data sampling (ADaS) algorithm. The Multibiosensor Data Sampling and Transmission Reduction with Decision-making (MuDaFuDeC) implements the machine learning model at the fog gateway to learn and decide the situation of the patient according to the received data from the biosensors. The performance evaluation shows that the MuDaFuDeC outperforms other approaches in terms of the data reduction percentage and energy consumption. It keeps a good representation of all the scores at the fog gateway and makes automated, fast, and accurate decisions based on the patient's condition.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Healthcare ICT includes a range of interventions including telemedicine, electronic health records (EHR), data analytics, artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and wearables devices. In achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the time has come to accelerate the development of affordable and sustainable health systems that respect people's needs and values. Because, as a component of a health program, it can augment capacity and improve the overall effectiveness of a health development program. Digitalization and technological advances, including sensors, are transforming connected healthcare into inclusive healthcare, enabling remote monitoring and support for chronically ill patients both inside and outside healthcare facilities. Therefore, wearable biosensors are becoming increasingly effective in the prevention, early diagnosis, control, and treatment of diseases. It has also been observed that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the world has undergone a radical shift in healthcare with a new shift towards Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). Assistive ICT also ensures safety, social communication, and greater independence for elderly and vulnerable people with chronic diseases. Bearing in this mind, ICT-assisted healthcare paradigm has been proposed that emphasizes on socio-economic and technoethical dimensions of healthcare services for health and wellbeing. © 2023 School of Science, IHU.

AB  - The usage of IoT in the medical field, often referred to as IoMT, plays a vital role in facilitating the exchange of sensitive data among medical devices. This capability significantly contributes to enhancing the quality of patient care. However, it comes with privacy issues that compromise the security of the data collected by medical sensors, making them vulnerable to potential cyber threats such as data modification, replay attacks, etc. These attacks can lead to significant data loss or unauthorized alterations. Machine learning, particularly in cyber-attack detection systems, is crucial for identifying and classifying such attacks. Yet, the main challenge lies in adapting to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of malicious attacks and creating scalable solutions to combat them. The objective of this paper is to detect cybersecurity threats, with a particular focus on man-in-the-middle attacks that occur within the IoMT communication network. The study utilizes principal component analysis (PCA) for feature reduction and employs multi-layer perceptron to classify unforeseen cyber-attack IoT-based healthcare devices. The study evaluates the effectiveness of this proposed strategy using real-time data from the St. Louis Enhanced Healthcare Monitoring System (WUSTL-EHMS). The findings indicate that the multi-layer perceptron outperforms other tested classifiers, achieving an accuracy score of 96.39%, while also improving the performance by reducing the time complexity. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, a wide variety of real-world problems are solved via cloud computing, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These methodologies are concerned with different areas like smart cities, agriculture, transportation systems, and healthcare systems. The existing researchers focused on the health care monitoring application along with IoT and cloud computing. It met several shortcomings in case of computational complexity, cost, time, and improper health care data storage and so forth. To overcome these challenges, the novel IoT-enabled secure healthcare monitoring model is proposed in this study. At first, several sensors are deployed in the human body thereby collecting patients' data with respect to vital parameters like body temperature deviation. The patient's health record dataset consists of 10 attributes namely phone numbers, marital status, address, age, name, heartbeat rate, oxygen level, smoking, temperature, and blood pressure. The data size reduction and normalization are performed in the IoT medical sensor dataset which contains the redundant or irrelevant attributes that are eliminated during pre-processing. The artificial hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based convolutional neural network (AHB-CNN) model performs both feature extraction and classification of cancer disease. The AHB-CNN model classifies whether the patient is prone to cancer or not based on the sensor input collected. The received results are then sent to the hospital management for analysis. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption method is mostly used in this study due to the major benefits it gives in terms of asymmetric encryption, ease of use, simpler deployment, and high security associated with factoring large prime numbers. A modified RSA algorithm is used in this article which uses the double encryption-decryption process and “n” prime numbers to enhance the security of the conventional RSA algorithm. The data is always encrypted during transit before being stored in the cloud or for further processing. Depending upon the experimental consequences, the proposed method established superior performances compared to other state-of-art techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - In this present time, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has been of considerable aid in the case of health monitoring and recovery. The exploitation of machine learning with an intelligent agent in the area of health informatics gathered using HAR augments the decision-making quality and significance. Although many research works conducted on Smart Healthcare Monitoring, there remain a certain number of pitfalls such as time, overhead, and falsification involved during analysis. Therefore, this paper proposes a Statistical Partial Regression and Support Vector Intelligent Agent Learning (SPR-SVIAL) for Smart Healthcare Monitoring. At first, the Statistical Partial Regression Feature Extraction model is used for data preprocessing along with the dimensionality-reduced features extraction process. Here, the input dataset the continuous beat-to-beat heart data, triaxial accelerometer data, and psychological characteristics were acquired from IoT wearable devices. To attain highly accurate Smart Healthcare Monitoring with less time, Partial Least Square helps extract the dimensionality-reduced features. After that, with these resulting features, SVIAL is proposed for Smart Healthcare Monitoring with the help of Machine Learning and Intelligent Agents to minimize both analysis falsification and overhead. Experimental evaluation is carried out for factors such as time, overhead, and false positive rate accuracy concerning several instances. The quantitatively analyzed results indicate the better performance of our proposed SPR-SVIAL method when compared with two state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a platform that combines Internet of Things (IoT) technology with medical applications, enabling the realization of precision medicine, intelligent healthcare, and telemedicine in the era of digitalization and intelligence. However, the IoMT faces various challenges, including sustainable power supply, human adaptability of sensors and the intelligence of sensors. In this study, we designed a robust and intelligent IoMT system through the synergistic integration of flexible wearable triboelectric sensors and deep learning-assisted data analytics. We embedded four triboelectric sensors into a wristband to detect and analyze limb movements in patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD). By further integrating deep learning-assisted data analytics, we actualized an intelligent healthcare monitoring system for the surveillance and interaction of PD patients, which includes location/trajectory tracking, heart monitoring and identity recognition. This innovative approach enabled us to accurately capture and scrutinize the subtle movements and fine motor of PD patients, thus providing insightful feedback and comprehensive assessment of the patients’ conditions. This monitoring system is cost-effective, easily fabricated, highly sensitive, and intelligent, consequently underscores the immense potential of human body sensing technology in a Health 4.0 society. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) is a rapidly growing field that promises to revolutionize health care. The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Architectural, cognitive, and service layers are the three components that come together to form the system as a whole. The data that is acquired by the instruments at the application layer is processed by the system that is in charge of the network. The conceptual layer, which is where edge sensors are put, is responsible for managing radio resource management and intersensor connections in order to solve the issues raised by the physical layer about increasing power consumption and increased latency. In response to the processed data provided by the logical layer, the application layer will make judgements. The key objective is to lower prices so that they are more accessible to regular people. Patients will not only be able to maintain their financial stability, but they will also have easy access to private therapy. This research presents a solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which will simplify the usage of a generally complicated medical device while allowing you to do it at a reasonable cost and in the comfort of your own home. The Elephant Herding Optimizations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) method is discussed here in order to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy patterns of behavior. The scoring function, also known as fuzzy logic, is used in order to arrive at a conclusion on the severity of the irregularity. In the end, tests were carried out to see how well the recommended work fared in contrast to the existing approaches in terms of specificity, recall, f1-score, and ROC curve. These metrics were examined.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Wearable devices and mobile sensors enable the real-time collection of an abundant source of physiological and behavioural data unobtrusively. Unlike traditional in-person evaluation or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) questionnaire-based approaches, these data sources open many possibilities in remote patient monitoring. However, defining robust models is challenging due to the data's noisy and frequently missing observations. This work proposes an attention-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network-based pipeline for predicting mobility impairment based on WHODAS 2.0 evaluation from such digital biomarkers. Furthermore, we addressed the missing observation problem by utilising hidden Markov models and the possibility of including information from unlabelled samples via transfer learning. We validated our approach using two wearable/mobile sensor data sets collected in the wild and socio-demographic information about the patients. Our results showed that in the WHODAS 2.0 mobility impairment prediction task, the proposed pipeline outperformed a prior baseline while additionally providing interpretability with attention heatmaps. Moreover, using a much smaller cohort via task transfer learning, the same model could learn to predict generalised anxiety severity accurately based on GAD-7 scores. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Ubiquitous computing has been a green research area that has managed to attract and sustain the attention of researchers for some time now. As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel. For the evaluation and testing of the proposed system, two openly accessible benchmark datasets, the ExtraSensory dataset and the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, were used. The system outperformed the available state-of-the-art systems by recognizing human activities with an accuracy of 88.25% and classifying the location with an accuracy of 90.63% over the ExtraSensory dataset, while, for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, the respective results were 96.00% and 90.50% accurate. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Serious clinical complications (SCC; CTCAE grade ≥ 3) occur frequently in patients treated for hematological malignancies. Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model. As a consequence, remote patient monitoring may enable pre-emptive complication management. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Post-surgical treatments of the human throat often require continuous monitoring of diverse vital and muscle activities. However, wireless, continuous monitoring and analysis of these activities directly from the throat skin have not been developed. Here, we report the design and validation of a fully integrated standalone stretchable device platform that provides wireless measurements and machine learning-based analysis of diverse vibrations and muscle electrical activities from the throat. We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects. The resulting standalone stretchable device with wireless monitoring and machine learning-based processing capabilities paves the way to design and apply wearable skin-interfaced systems for the remote monitoring and treatment evaluation of various diseases. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The emergence of low-cost individual sensing devices has facilitated the application of data fusion methods to yield insights useful for score-level, rank-level, or hybrid-level fusion. Intelligent tools for fusion processing, such as fuzzy methods and optimization algorithms, may be used to the deluge of raw data generated by these devices. The use of numerous sensors allows for multi-level/hybrid-level fusion, and the combination of several models for intelligent systems allows for fusion system design optimized for score improvement. Multimedia data fusion applications and machine learning methods can be used to accomplish data fusion in cloud settings. For older people in independent living conditions, a physical activity assessment framework (PAAF) that uses deep learning models for fusion to identify activity and evaluate progress based on the spectral domain of each window is needed. This study highlights the significance of data fusion in outlining the needs for IoT devices in networked computers for distant patient monitoring. In order to provide for the health of the elderly without compromising their comfort or freedom of choice, we need a seniors network based on the Internet of Things and wearable health technology. The sensors’ functionality was investigated by analyzing data gathered from the environment and the organisms within it. The proposed PAAF-IoT architecture has many layers, each one connected to a different device, with the most important part being the integration of data from all of them to classify types of physical activity. Cloud services geographically close to the customer are used to process the resulting mountain of data, reducing end-to-end delay and facilitating prompt responses from healthcare professionals. Data fusion in healthcare and remote patient monitoring are demonstrated through the deployment of an app that allows doctors to remotely administer prescriptions and maintain track of patients’ medical histories. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

AB  - Smart healthcare monitoring systems are proliferating due to the Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled portable medical devices. The IoT and deep learning in the healthcare sector prevent diseases by evolving healthcare from face-to-face consultation to telemedicine. To protect athletes’ life from life-threatening severe conditions and injuries in training and competitions, real-time monitoring of physiological indicators is critical. In this research work, we present a deep learning-based IoT-enabled real-time health monitoring system. The proposed system uses wearable medical devices to measure vital signs and apply various deep learning algorithms to extract valuable information. For this purpose, we have taken Sanda athletes as our case study. The deep learning algorithms help physicians properly analyze these athletes’ conditions and offer the proper medications to them, even if the doctors are away. The performance of the proposed system is extensively evaluated using a cross-validation test by considering various statistical-based performance measurement metrics. The proposed system is considered an effective tool that diagnoses dreadful diseases among the athletes, such as brain tumors, heart disease, cancer, etc. The performance results of the proposed system are evaluated in terms of precision, recall, AUC, and F1, respectively. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In many sectors, including healthcare services, Internet of Things (IoT) systems are growing rapidly, providing promising technological, economical, and social potential. Healthcare services can be improved with IoT capabilities, including remote patient monitoring, diagnosis of medical issues in real-time, and more, all of which improves both the quality and the satisfaction of human users. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is gaining momentum as wearable devices, and their numerous health monitoring applications increase popularity. The IoMT plays a significant role in reducing death rates by detecting diseases early. Prediction of heart disease is an essential challenge in clinical dataset analysis. The proposed research aim is to employ machine learning (ML) classification algorithms to predict heart disease. The IoMT-based cloud-fog diagnostics for heart disease have been proposed. Fog layer is used to quickly analyze patient data using ML classification techniques. The performance of the healthcare model is evaluated with different simulations and achieves 97.32% accuracy, 97.58% recall, 97.16% precision, 97.37% F1 -measure, 96.87% specificity, and 97.22% G -mean, which has significant improvement as compared with previous models.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - In the midst of a global health crisis, it is of utmost importance for healthcare technologies to possess the capability to regulate and monitor the physiological variables of patients remotely and automatically. The effective control of mean arterial pressure (MAP) in a closed-loop manner is particularly critical for individuals who are critically ill or in the process of recovering from surgical procedures. Within the framework of the present research, an adaptive closed-loop structure has been formulated with the objective of controlling a patient's MAP through governed administration of the medication sodium nitroprusside (SNP), to attain the desired MAP levels under varying conditions. The proposed closed-loop technique incorporates an intelligent controller known as the active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with the intention of tracking the desired MAP value, alongside the utilization of continuous action policy gradient (CAPG) for the optimization of the controller's coefficients. Under the DRL strategy, an actor is responsible for generating policy requests, while a critic assesses the efficacy of the actor's policy directives. This approach uses gradient descent to train the weight values of both actor and critic networks, and it is dependent on the reward return linked to the MAP fault. Upon comparing the outcomes of the recommended structure with conventional models, numerical simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed system in coping with varying working conditions, key-value fluctuations, and uncertainties, while effectively maintaining the desired mean arterial pressure and drug administration rate.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Heart disease is a leading cause of death in India. Many times, heart diseases do not show symptoms until they become a matter of concern. This silent nature calls for real time monitoring of vitals. In this paper, we propose a healthcare monitoring system which makes use of existing wearable devices to measure vitals of the user’s body. The data gathered is used to perform real time analysis to detect any irregularities and simultaneously to predict if there are any underlying problems that might be of future concern. © 2023, Semarak Ilmu Publishing.

AB  - Falling is one of the primary causes of firefighter casualties. Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters' data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system's heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification. This study enhances the practicability of PIFDS and extends the application range of PIFDS from healthcare to firefighting.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - There are no clear guidelines for diuretic administration in heart failure (HF), and reliable markers are needed to tailor treatment. Continuous monitoring of multiple advanced physiological parameters during diuresis may allow better differentiation of patients into subgroups according to their responses. In this study, 29 HF patients were monitored during outpatient intravenous diuresis, using a noninvasive wearable multi-parameter monitor. Analysis of changes in these parameters during the course of diuresis aimed to recognize subgroups with different response patterns. Parameters did not change significantly, however, subgroup analysis of the last quartile of treatment showed significant differences in cardiac output, cardiac index, stroke volume, pulse rate, and systemic vascular resistance according to gender, and in systolic blood pressure according to habitus. Changes in the last quartile could be differentiated using k-means, a technique of unsupervised machine learning. Moreover, patients’ responses could be best clustered into four groups. Analysis of baseline parameters showed that two of the clusters differed by baseline parameters, body mass index, and diabetes status. To conclude, we show that physiological changes during diuresis in HF patients can be categorized into subgroups sharing similar response trends, making noninvasive monitoring a potential key to personalized treatment in HF. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Wearable sensor (WS) technology and social media platforms (SMPs) are increasingly being used to monitor healthcare, and this has opened up new possibilities as chronic illnesses become more common. The development of a novel technique for gathering patient data for effective healthcare monitoring relies heavily on WS and SMP. But WS-based continuous patient monitoring produces a great deal of healthcare data. Furthermore, the user-generated health information on social networking sites is unstructured and produced in massive amounts. The current healthcare monitoring systems struggle to adequately analyze the useful information that may be gleaned from social networking and sensor data. Additionally, processing healthcare big data for anomaly prediction does not work well with conventional machine learning methods. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose an automated healthcare monitoring system for better categorization accuracy via accurate data storage and analysis. A novel fuzzy binary temporal long short-term memory (FBTLSTM) approach is used to appropriately categorize healthcare data and forecast drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Patients' healthcare data, including diabetes, blood pressure, mental health, and drug evaluations, is used to categorize their health status in the proposed system. The findings demonstrate that the suggested model accurately manages heterogeneous data, enhances the categorization of medical conditions, and improves the predictability of drug side effects. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

AB  - Digitized telemedicine tools with the Internet of Things (IoT) started advancing into our daily lives and have been incorporated with commercial wearable gadgets for noninvasive remote health monitoring. The newly established tools have been steered toward a new era of decentralized healthcare. The advancement of a telemedicine wearable monitoring system has attracted enormous interest in the multimodal big data acquisition of real-time physiological and biochemical information via noninvasive methods for any health-related industries. The expectation of telemedicine wearable creation has been focused on early diagnosis of multiple diseases and minimizing the cost of high-tech and invasive treatments. However, only limited progress has been directed toward the development of telemedicine wearable sensors. This Perspective addresses the advancement of these wearable sensors that encounter multiple challenges on the forefront and technological gaps hampering the realization of health monitoring at molecular levels related to smart materials mostly limited to single use, issues of selectivity to analytes, low sensitivity to targets, miniaturization, and lack of artificial intelligence to perform multiple tasks and secure big data transfer. Sensor stability with minimized signal drift, on-body sensor reusability, and long-term continuous health monitoring provides key analytical challenges. This Perspective also focuses on, promotes, and highlights wearable sensors with a distinct capability to interconnect with telemedicine healthcare for physical sensing and multiplex sensing at deeper levels. Moreover, it points out some critical challenges in different material aspects and promotes what it will take to advance the current state-of-art wearable sensors for telemedicine healthcare. Ultimately, this Perspective is to draw attention to some potential blind spots of wearable technology development and to inspire further development of this integrated technology in mitigating multimorbidity in aging societies through health monitoring at molecular levels to identify signs of diseases. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a fundamental framework for interconnected device communication, representing a relatively new paradigm and the evolution of the Internet into its next phase. Its significance is pronounced in diverse fields, especially healthcare, where it finds applications in scenarios such as medical service tracking. By analyzing patterns in observed parameters, the anticipation of disease types becomes feasible. Stress monitoring with wearable sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a potential application that can enhance wellness and preventative health management. Healthcare professionals have harnessed robust systems incorporating battery-based wearable technology and wireless communication channels to enable cost-effective healthcare monitoring for various medical conditions. Network-connected sensors, whether within living spaces or worn on the body, accumulate data crucial for evaluating patients' health. The integration of machine learning and cutting-edge technology has sparked research interest in addressing stress levels. Psychological stress significantly impacts a person's physiological parameters. Stress can have negative impacts over time, prompting sometimes costly therapies. Acute stress levels can even constitute a life-threatening risk, especially in people who have previously been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or schizophrenia. To offer a proactive solution within the realm of smart healthcare, this article introduces a novel machine learning-based system termed "Stress-Track". The device is intended to track a person's stress levels by examining their body temperature, sweat, and motion rate during physical activity. The proposed model achieves an impressive accuracy rate of 99.5%, showcasing its potential impact on stress management and healthcare enhancement.

AB  - Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) focuses on the improvement of health or the prevention of further disease progression after an event. Despite the documented benefits of CR programs, the participation remains suboptimal. Home-based CR programs have been proposed to improve uptake and adherence. The goal of this study was to apply an end-to-end methodology including machine learning techniques to predict the 6-month adherence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients to a home-based telemonitoring CR program, combining patients’ clinical information with their actual program participation during a short familiarization phase. Fifty CVD patients participated in such a program for 6 months, enabling personalized guidance during a phase III CR study. Clinical, fitness, and psychological data were measured at baseline, whereas actual adherence, in terms of weekly exercise session duration and patient heart rate, was measured using wearables. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify different groups based on (1) patients’ clinical baseline characteristics, (2) exercise adherence during the familiarization phase, and (3) the whole program adherence, whereas the output of the clustering was determined using repetitive decision trees (DTs) and random forest (RF) techniques to predict long-term adherence. Finally, for each cluster of patients, network analysis was applied to discover correlations of their characteristics that link to adherence. Based on baseline characteristics, patients were clustered into three groups, with differences in behavior and risk factors, whereas adherent, non-adherent, and transient adherent patients were identified during the familiarization phase. Regarding the prediction of long-term adherence, the most common DT showed higher performance compared with RF (precision: 80.2 ± 19.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8%, recall: 94.5 ± 14.5% and 71.8 ± 25.8% for DT and RF accordingly). The analysis of the DT rules and the analysis of the feature importance of the RF model highlighted the significance of non-adherence during the familiarization phase, as well as that of the baseline characteristics to predict future adherence. Network analysis revealed different relationships in different clusters of patients and the interplay between their behavioral characteristics. In conclusion, the main novelty of this study is the application of machine learning techniques combining patient characteristics before the start of the home-based CR programs with data during a short familiarization phase, which can predict long-term adherence with high accuracy. The data used in this study are available through connected health technologies and standard measurements in CR; thus, the proposed methodology can be generalized to other telerehabilitation programs and help healthcare providers to improve patient-tailored enrolment strategies and resource allocation. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Human life has become smarter by utilizing big data, telecommunication technologies, and wearable sensors over pervasive computing to give better healthcare services. Big data is built with the possibility to improve the healthcare industry. Big data makes the interconnection between patients, wearable sensors, healthcare caregivers, and providers through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and software. Most of the economic challenges in developing countries are caused by the healthcare sector, which occurs predominantly due to the increasing population requiring more quality of care concerning older people. Older people need great attention and care as they lead with irreparable damages when a minor accident or insignificant disease occurs. Therefore, the necessity of implementing new technologies and tools has arisen to support senior citizens regarding their healthcare. Various advancements in wireless technology, miniaturization, computing power, and processing made diverse healthcare innovations that led to developing the connected medical devices. Hence, this proposal develops a new healthcare monitoring system for tracking the activities of elderly people, where the Hadoop MapReduce technique for parallel processing the large-sized data. The data collected as mentioned in the available datasets is performed by using the numerous wearable sensors fixed on the ‘‘subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest’’ that are transformed to the cloud platform and also to the data analytics layer according to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The given input undergoes data splitting to produce tiny chunks. These small chunks of the input files are then considered as Map tasks. Here, in the map phase, the features are optimally selected by the Hybrid Dingo Coyote Optimization (HDCO). The combiner phase classifies the physical activities using the developed Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) consisting of classifiers such as ‘‘Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)’’. The parameter tuning in these classifiers is done by the same HDCO. The reducer phase extracts data from different chunks by merging the same classes. The developed HDCO-DEL has secured 13.66%, 16.01%, 17.33%, 13.6%, and 14.01% better accuracy than ELM, CNN, LSTM, DBN, DNN, and HealthFog, respectively on second dataset. The comparison with existing methods shows its better performance and also predicts physical activities with overall high accuracy. 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Today's healthcare sectors are driven and work to rescue patients as soon as possible by giving them the right care and treatment. A healthcare monitoring system works in two ways: by keeping track of the patient's activities and overall health. For prompt treatment, such as giving the right and suitable medication, administering an injection, and providing additional medical help, nursing supervision is required. Wearable sensors are fixed or connected to the patient's body and can follow their health. These IoT medical gadgets let clinicians diagnose patients and comprehend the processes from remote. However, the amount of data produced by IoT devices is so large that it cannot be handled manually. A model for automated analysis is required. Convolution Neural Network with Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) was therefore suggested in this study as a Hybrid Deep Learning Framework (HDLF) for a Patient Activity Monitoring System (PAMS) that brings all healthcare activities with its classes. To incorporate medical specialists from all over the world and enhance treatment outcomes, the framework offers an advanced model where patient activities, health conditions, medications, and other activities are distributed in the cloud. An effective architecture for Wearable Sensor Network-based Human Action Recognition that combines neural network Simple Recurrent Units (SRUs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). For assessing the multimodal data input sequence, deep SRUs and a variety of internal memory states is utilized in this research. Furthermore, for addressing the concerns about accuracy oscillations or instability with decreasing gradients, a deep GRUs to store and learn the knowledge is conveyed to the future state. The analysis suggests that CNN-LSTM is then contrasted with some of the currently used algorithms, and it is found that the new system has a 99.53% accuracy rate. The difference between this accuracy result and the current value is at least 4.73%.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Telemedicine can provide benefits in patient affected by chronic diseases or elderly citizens as part of standard routine care supported by digital health. The GATEKEEPER (GK) Project was financed to create a vendor independent platform to be adopted in medical practice and to demonstrate its effect, benefit value, and scalability in 8 connected medical use cases with some independent pilots. This paper, after a description of the GK platform architecture, is focused on the creation of a FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource) IG (Implementation Guide) and its adoption in specific use cases. The final aim is to combine conventional data, collected in the hospital, with unconventional data, coming from wearable devices, to exploit artificial intelligence (AI) models designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new parsimonious risk prediction model for Type 2 diabetes (T2D).

AB  - Healthcare sensors represent a valid and non-invasive instrument to capture and analyse physiological data. Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices. Moreover, the evaluation of the vowel /e/ allows the detection of the effects of COVID-19 on voice quality with a better accuracy than the other vowels. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2022.; The rapid development of flexible electronic technology has led to the in-depth study of flexible wearable sensors to achieve accurate sensing under different external stimuli. However, it is still a huge challenge to develop hydrogel-based wearable skin-like sensors with super ductility, high sensitivity, and self-healing properties. Herein, the Ti3C2 type of MXene was synthesized, and the Ag/MXene nanocomplexes were incorporated into polyvinyl alcohol-borax matrix to construct a novel composite hydrogel as the multifunctional nanofillers, which could bring both improved properties and novel functionalities. The Ag/MXene-Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel displayed integrated merits of highly strain sensitive (GF = 3.26), self-healing (within 10 min, 91% healing efficiency), and excellent antibacterial activity. The hydrogel could be assembled into a wearable skin-like sensor to monitor human movement, including large deformations (finger, elbow, wrist, and knee bending) and tiny deformations (mouth’s movement and throat vocalization) in real time. Therefore, this work shed a new light on the development of flexible wearable skin-like sensors for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The remarkable increase in the number of patients poses challenges to healthcare providers in telemedicine systems, and certain challenges are associated with the difficulties of identifying the most urgent emergencies to save lives. Remote monitoring of patients with multiple chronic diseases (MCDs) is a major issue that must be addressed. This work aims to improve the triage system for remote patients who are far from hospital and use telemedicine system by considering the variation in their chronic diseases (chronic heart, hypertension, hypotension, and diabetes diseases). The proposed framework named machine learning-based remote triage framework in telemedicine (ML-ART) collects the patient’s data using medical sensors and sources within Internet of medical things (IoMT) environment, transfers the data through gateway to telemedicine servers in the hospital, where machine learning is performed to classify (triages) each patient into one of five categories (normal, cold, sick, urgent, and risk) depending on the medical emergency level of the patients. The simulation results showed that the decision tree (DT) algorithm has the most accurate result, 100%, compared to the relevant algorithm (neural network (NN) 97%, support vector machine (SVM) 91%, and random forest (RF) 97%). The performance of (DT) logically matched the medical triage procedure. Moreover, the (ML-ART) outcomes improve the performance of e-triage system for remote patients and pave the way for future works in telemedicine systems through moving from remote monitoring to remote diagnostics. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Smart home monitoring systems via internet of things (IoT) are required for taking care of elders at home. They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system’s results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The age profiles of many countries are increasing day by day with increasing population of individuals affected by the chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity and so on. In order to maintain the individual living, remote health monitoring with daily activity by recognising people is a promising solution. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality globally. Most of the deaths due to CVD are sudden and without any chance of medical help. In order to avoid this accidental death, precautions are required with continuous monitoring of body parameters such as heart rate, pulse rate and electrocardiogram (ECG) to show the current status of the health. Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly growing industry in many disciplines including healthcare. In current research, heart disease is monitored with processing of electrocardiogram signals. The existing monitoring system lacks in prediction accuracy and remote monitoring. In this proposed work, the gathered data from the wearable devices are preprocessed to remove the noise. The relevant features for better recognition are selected using the proposed LBPNet with particle swarm optimisation (PSO). Then sequential minimal optimisation based SVM classifier recognises the abnormalities of heart disease from normal patients for diagnosis. These data are available in remote servers for doctors and care takers with IoT application. The care takers are notified about the patient health using smart phones. This proposed system is useful for cardiac patient monitoring and updation with high accuracy. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - In the era of pervasive computing and wearable technology, the accurate recognition of human activities has gained paramount importance across a spectrum of applications, from healthcare monitoring to smart environments. This paper introduces a novel methodology that leverages the fusion of multi-sensor data with deep learning techniques to enhance the precision and robustness of human activity recognition. Our approach commences with the transformation of accelerometer and gyroscope time-series data into recurrence plots, facilitating the distillation of temporal patterns and dependencies. Subsequently, a dual-path convolutional network framework is employed to extract intricate sensory patterns independently, followed by an attention module that fuses these features, capturing their nuanced interactions. Rigorous experimental evaluations, including comparative analyses against traditional machine learning baselines, validate the superior performance of our methodology. The results demonstrate remarkable classification performance, underscoring the efficacy of our approach in recognizing a diverse range of human activities. Our research not only advances the state-of-the-art in activity recognition but also highlights the potential of deep learning and multi-sensor data fusion in enabling context-aware systems for the benefit of society. © 2023, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG).

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) based Arrhythmia Classification is a cutting-edge algorithm that amalgamates the abilities of the IoT and advanced medical diagnosis to revolutionize the detection and classification of arrhythmias— irregular heartbeats that may indicate fundamental cardiovascular issues. This technique leverages IoT devices, namely connected health monitors and wearable sensors, to continuously gather electrocardiogram (ECG) information from individuals. This information, streamed in real-time, provides a great opportunity for timely and remote monitoring of cardiac health. Leveraging the abilities of deep learning and IoT, this technique provides an automated and more sophisticated means of classifying and detecting arrhythmias, improving the efficiency and accuracy of diagnoses. This article presents an Internet of Things Enabled Based Arrhythmia Classification using the Dandelion Optimization Algorithm with Ensemble Learning (AC-DOAEL) method. The presented AC-DOAEL technique utilizes IoT-based data collection with an ensemble learning-based classification process. For the arrhythmia detection and classification process, the AC-DOAEL technique follows an ensemble learning algorithm such as long short-term memory (LSTM), autoencoder (AE), and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) models. To improve the recognition rate of the ensemble models, the AC-DOAEL technique uses DOA as a hyperparameter optimizer. The simulation outcomes of the AC-DOAEL method are well-studied on benchmark ECG data. The experimental result analysis inferred the greater performance of the AC-DOAEL algorithm with other techniques. © 2024, American Scientific Publishing Group (ASPG). All rights reserved.

AB  - Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient's smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson's Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners - Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Hospital readmission prediction models often perform poorly, but most only use information collected until the time of hospital discharge. In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Digital health and telemonitoring have resulted in a wealth of information to be collected to monitor, manage, and improve human health. The multi-source mixed-frequency health data overwhelm the modeling capacity of existing statistical and machine learning models, due to many challenging properties. Although predictive analytics for big health data plays an important role in telemonitoring, there is a lack of rigorous prediction model that can automatically predicts patients’ health conditions, e.g., Disease Severity Indicators (DSIs), from multi-source mixed-frequency data. Sleep disorder is a prevalent cardiac syndrome that is characterized by abnormal respiratory patterns during sleep. Although wearable devices are available to administrate sleep studies at home, the manual scoring process to generate the DSI remains a bottleneck in automated monitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder. To address the multi-fold challenges for precise prediction of the DSI from high-dimensional multi-source mixed-frequency data in sleep disorder, we propose a sparse linear mixed model that combines the modified Cholesky decomposition with group lasso penalties to enable joint group selection of fixed effects and random effects. A novel Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm integrated with an efficient Majorization Maximization (MM) algorithm is developed for model estimation of the proposed sparse linear mixed model with group variable selection. The proposed method was applied to the SHHS data for telemonitoring and diagnosis of sleep disorder and found that a few significant feature groups that are consistent with prior medical studies on sleep disorder. The proposed method also outperformed a few benchmark methods with the highest prediction accuracy. © 2023 “IISE”.

AB  - A smart healthcare network can use sensors and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance patient care while decreasing healthcare expenditures. It has become more difficult for healthcare providers to keep track and analyze the massive amounts of data it generates. Health care data created by IoT devices and e-health systems must be handled more efficiently. A wide range of healthcare industries can benefit from machine learning (ML) algorithms in the digital world. However, each of these algorithms has to be taught to anticipate or solve a certain problem. IoT-enabled healthcare data and health monitoring-based machine learning algorithms (IoT-HDHM-MLA) have been proposed to solve the difficulties faced by healthcare providers. Sensors and IoT devices are vital for monitoring an individual's health. The proposed IoT-HDHM-MLA aims to deliver healthcare services via remote monitoring with experts and machine learning algorithms. In this system, patients are monitored in real-time for various key characteristics using a collection of small wireless wearable nodes. The health care business benefits from systematic data collection and efficient data mining. Thus, the experimental findings demonstrate that IoT-HDHM-MLA enhances efficiency in patient health surveillance. © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

This article introduces a possible Cybertwin based multimodal network (beyond 5G) for electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns monitoring during daily activity. This network paradigm consists of a cloud-centric network and several Cybertwin communication ends. The Cybertwin nodes combine support locator/identifier identification, data caching, behavior logger, and communications assistant in the edge cloud. The application focuses on monitoring the ECG patterns during daily activity because few studies analyze them under different motions. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based human activity recognition classifier to enhance identification accuracy. The healthcare monitoring values and potential clinical medicine are provided by the Cybertwin based network for ECG patterns observing.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Post-discharge oncologic surgical complications are costly for patients, families, and healthcare systems. The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. Methods: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. Results: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. Conclusions: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven adaptive techniques are viable to optimize the resources in the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wearable healthcare devices. Due to the miniature size and ability of wireless data transfer, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have become the center of attention in current medical media technologies. For a long-term and reliable healthcare system, high energy efficiency, transmission reliability, and longer battery lifetime of wearable sensors devices are required. There is a dire need for empowering sensor-based wearable techniques in BSNs from every aspect i.e., data collection, healthcare monitoring, and diagnosis. The consideration of protocol layers, data routing, and energy optimization strategies improves the efficiency of healthcare delivery. Hence, this work presents some key contributions. Firstly, it proposes a novel avant-garde framework to simultaneously optimize the energy efficiency, battery lifetime, and reliability for smart and connected healthcare. Secondly, in this study, an Adaptive Transmission Data Rate (ATDR) mechanism is proposed, which works on the average constant energy consumption by varying the active time of the sensor node to optimize the energy over the dynamic wireless channel. Moreover, a Self-Adaptive Routing Algorithm (SARA) is developed to adopt a dynamic source routing mechanism with an energy-efficient and shortest possible path, unlike the conventional routing methods. Lastly, real-time datasets are adopted for intensive experimental setup for revealing pervasive and cost-effective healthcare through wearable devices. It is observed and analysed that proposed algorithms outperform in terms of high energy efficiency, better reliability, and longer battery lifetime of portable devices.  © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - To track vital signs on the wrist, a wearable system, named WrisTee, has been developed for remote health monitoring. Using three optical sensors with four light sources, WrisTee allows users to measure 12 photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals at three locations on the radial artery. Two types of PPG signals with opposite polarities were discovered and designated as in-phase and invert-phase signals. We provided a unified viewpoint regarding their differences based on the Beer $-$ Lambert law, and showed that both signals can be used for heart monitoring using data analyzed from a selected subject. Using reflective pulse-transition time (R-PTT) and the standard deviation of R-PTT ($\sigma _{R\text{-}PTT}$), we proposed a method for selecting the optimal wavelength to achieve the best quality signal, thus minimizing storage requirements, power resources, and computational costs. We conducted an experiment on ten subjects to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed method. Our results demonstrated that WrisTee is capable of finding the optimal positions and wavelengths for monitoring vital signs. To automatically detect the PPG phases, six machine learning (ML) models were explored to assess their accuracy for PPG-phase classification. The experimental results show that a convolutional neural network can be the best candidate for phase classification. Hence, it can be integrated into WrisTee for noninvasive health monitoring such as heart rate, heart rate variability, or blood pressure. Our work paves a new direction in bio-signal medical researches by adopting in-phase and invert-phase PPGs for healthcare monitoring. © 2009-2012 IEEE.

AB  - The health care system is overwhelming with COVID-19 patients since the end of 2019. Many countries have postponed their public screening programs and are fighting to maintain balance between essential health care and COVID-19 pandemic. At this point of time, IoT along with artificial intelligence (AI) provides a solution for a remote IoT based healthcare system. IoT based wearable devices collect data and send them to the cloud via IoT Gateway. Further, the data are analyzed by AI to raise alerts at times of emergencies like a sudden drop-in pulse rate etc. AI needs a large database for training and processing. This threatens the patient’s data security and privacy. To overcome this threat, an encryption algorithm can be used. When it comes to remote healthcare, monitoring of cardio vascular muscles is the most important of all. This can be done by an electrocardiogram (ECG). These ECG signals are transmitted in case of emergency and are stored in remote servers. The ECG signals are unique in nature and they can be used in biometric devices which attract hackers. To avoid the intruders, the data is encrypted and transmitted. In this paper, we provide a lightweight cellular automaton (CA) based encryption algorithm to suit limited power and low memory devices. For ECG based evaluation, the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database is considered. © 2021 Totem Publisher, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. Objective: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. Methods: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. Results: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. ©Karen Larimer, Stephan Wegerich, Joel Splan, David Chestek, Heather Prendergast, Terry Vanden Hoek.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) development made it possible for technology to communicate physical education by connecting cost-effective heterogeneous devices and digital applications to uncontrolled and accessible environments. The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits. The IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring device is proposed to track students' physical activity and enhance outcomes. The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner. In addition, this study examines the connections between monitoring ability which is an essential component for sports activities and physical activity. This system collects essential information from IoT-based wearable devices that interact with the data in real time by virtualizing the device. The IoT network includes several device activities and monitors the heartbeat and physical body temperature of a person. The analysis of specific studies and student feedback shows that the designed virtual system of physical educations is effective in its application and implementation and provides a reliable guide for developing student physical educational systems. The experimental analysis is evaluated; the solution offered is developing and supporting physical education and training approaches in reality and creates healthy environment systems to solve the health monitoring challenges posed by IoT devices. The proposed method has achieved extraordinary physical activity monitoring compared to the conventional systems, as shown by experimental findings. The simulation analysis of physical education can help students and improve the associated aspects of physical abilities with high accuracy ratio (98.3), prediction ratio (96.5%), interaction ratio (94.4%), performance ratio (95.1%), the efficiency ratio (93.2), F-score (92.2%), and reduce error rate (17.5%) and physical activity patterns. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Physiotherapy is a critical element in the successful conservative management of low back pain (LBP). A gold standard for quantitatively measuring physiotherapy participation is crucial to understanding physiotherapy adherence in managing recovery from LBP. Objective: This study aimed to develop and evaluate a system with wearable inertial sensors to objectively detect the performance of unsupervised exercises for LBP comprising movement in multiple planes and sitting postures. Methods: A quantitative classification design was used within a machine learning framework to detect exercise performance and posture in a cohort of healthy participants. A set of 8 inertial sensors were placed on the participants, and data were acquired as they performed 7 McKenzie low back exercises and 3 sitting posture positions. Engineered time series features were extracted from the data and used to train 9 models by using a 6-fold cross-validation approach, from which the best 2 models were selected for further study. In addition, a convolutional neural network was trained directly on the time series data. A feature importance analysis was performed to identify sensor locations and channels that contributed the most to the models. Finally, a subset of sensor locations and channels was included in a hyperparameter grid search to identify the optimal sensor configuration and best performing algorithms for exercise and posture classification. The final models were evaluated using the F1 score in a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Results: In total, 19 healthy adults with no history of LBP each completed at least one full session of exercises and postures. Random forest and XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) models performed the best out of the initial set of 9 engineered feature models. The optimal hardware configuration was identified as a 3-sensor setup—lower back, left thigh, and right ankle sensors with acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer channels. The XGBoost model achieved the highest exercise (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.03) and posture (F1 score: mean 0.90, SD 0.11) classification scores. The convolutional neural network achieved similar results with the same sensor locations, using only the accelerometer and gyroscope channels for exercise classification (F1 score: mean 0.94, SD 0.02) and the accelerometer channel alone for posture classification (F1 score: mean 0.88, SD 0.07). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of a 3-sensor lower body wearable solution (eg, smart pants) that can identify exercises in multiple planes and proper sitting postures, which is suitable for the treatment of LBP. This technology has the potential to improve the effectiveness of LBP rehabilitation by facilitating quantitative feedback, early problem diagnosis, and possible remote monitoring. © Abdalrahman Alfakir, Colin Arrowsmith, David Burns, Helen Razmjou, Michael Hardisty, Cari Whyne.

AB  - Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively. The results of state-of-the-art efficient system show a significant increase in detection accuracy when compared to standard systems.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The role of artificial intelligence (AI) in facilitating the real-time processing of data is revolutionising the future of healthcare through mobile diagnostics, remote monitoring devices, and wearable technology products. The rise in digital wearables for remote healthcare is evolving at an increasing pace towards patient-centred and personalised care with connected patients. This transformation is creating new opportunities for designers to increase patients' participation and sustain their engagement in remote healthcare. In this paper, the authors have investigated the role of gender in aesthetic design in the context of digital health wearables to enhance user engagement and interaction. The investigations were conducted through participatory design sessions and showed a constructive relationship between aesthetic preferences and understanding the influence of gender as a means of facilitating user engagement with digital health wearables. This paper presents a novel user response model that leads to suggestions for future work, including research in the areas of gender awareness in aesthetics to move beyond traditional, stereotypical, and pre-identified gendered characteristics related to femininity and masculinity. The findings conclude with a path forwards for design research to promote gender awareness in aesthetic design for the realisation of healthcare wearables of the future. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The continuous growth in wearable sensors technology has inspired researchers to design novel models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). The wearable sensor-based HAR has covered various context-aware application areas, such as health care, surveillance, security, sports, military, and many more. The deep learning models have been widely used in HAR for their proven performance by automatically extracting the efficient features from the raw sensor data. The different source and destination subjects with their non-identical environment degrade the model’s performance, and the practical applicability remains a challenge. To tackle this, Inter-Domain Activities Analysis (IDAA)-based Deep-Transfer Heterogeneous HAR (DeepTransHHAR) model is proposed in this paper. The IDAA approach uses the Wasserstein distance metric for measuring the data distribution distance between the source and target subjects, and DeepTransHHAR model is used for feature extraction and activities recognition. Two publically available datasets HHAR and KU-HAR with non-identical properties in terms of the number of subjects, activities, wearable sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope), devices, and the sampling rates are used for experimental evaluation. The experimental result shows that the IDAA strategy helps to improve the HAR performance significantly in the non-identical environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.

AB  - This work addresses the design, development and implementation of a 4.0-based wearable soft transducer for patient-centered vitals telemonitoring. In particular, first, the soft transducer measures hypertension-related vitals (heart rate, oxygen saturation and systolic/diastolic pressure) and sends the data to a remote database (which can be easily consulted both by the patient and the physician). In addition to this, a dedicated deep learning algorithm, based on a Long-Short-Term-Memory Autoencoder, was designed, implemented and tested for providing an alert when the patient’s vitals exceed certain thresholds, which are automatically personalized for the specific patient. Furthermore, a mobile application (EcO2u) was developed to manage the entire data flow and facilitate the data fruition; this application also implements an innovative face-detection algorithm that ensures the identity of the patient. The robustness of the proposed soft transducer was validated experimentally on five individuals, who used the system for 30 days. The experimental results demonstrated an accuracy in anomaly detection greater than 93%, with a true positive rate of more than 94%. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Superhydrophobic wearable textile electronics are of great promising devices due to their broad application in healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence, etc. MXenes, the emerging two‐dimensional (2D) carbides and carbonitrides, are ideal candidates for fabricating wearable electronic devices. However, in an effort to maintain its highly conductive and long-term stability of cotton fabrics under harsh condition, it is an imperative demand to prepare superhydrophobic MXenes-textile sensor. Herein, a waterproof, highly sensitive, and wearable multi-mode sensor was successfully fabricated by the construction of 2D MXene nanosheets and zero-dimension (0D) silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) onto a cotton fibers substrate (MX@SiNPs cotton). The as-cultivated MX@SiNPs cotton exhibited an integration of high-performance sensing toward pression, bending, and torsion, superior sensitivity (S1 = 12.23 kPa−1), a stable response under press-relaxing cycles, and broad sensing ranges (pressure: 8.8 Pa – 70 kPa, bending: 0 – 180°, torsion: 0 – 628 rad m−1). By virtue of its hierarchical structure and low surface energy of the SiNPs layer, the MXenes-textile sensor can maintain intrinsic conductivity under wet and corrosive conditions. The waterproof and highly sensitive MXene-reinforced cotton fabrics lay a basis for the broad-range application and large-scale preparation of the sensor and prolong its service life. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Monitoring the health of humans in everyday life is quite challenging. Smart wearables have been increasingly important in recent technologies for monitoring and indicating our current health status, which is utilised to appropriately diagnose our health. Monitoring animals' health raises several concerns. We must wait for veterinary specialists to assess and diagnose whether the animals are suffering only in known regions. The result is delayed treatment and degradation of animal health. Therefore, primary health diagnosis is needed. However, mounting equipment was required to identify these features. This research leads to the recognition of the behaviour of animals through this technique, which facilitates the assessment of the health of animals. The use of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and IoT features an Animals Smart Healthcare Monitoring (ASHM) system for this research to track animal behavior with high precision using sensors and to detect animals' health with great precision. We proposed designing a system that would track the movement and health of an animal. This can be achieved by developing a system with animal smart health monitoring system. The sensor can be mounted on the animal body to get the desired physiological parameters like temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, ECG, and Blood pressure. This health surveillance system method has reduced the mean latency by 75% and provides results with an output accuracy of 98%. © 2022 Lavoisier. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multifunctional tactile sensors that can mimic the sensory capabilities of human skin to perceive various external static and dynamic stimuli are essential to interact with the environment and humans for wearable electronics and soft intelligent robotics. Here, inspired by human skin, we report a textile-based tactile sensor capable of multifunctional sensing for personalized healthcare monitoring and soft robotic control. The tactile sensor consists of a triboelectric nanogenerator sensing layer to mimic the function of fast adapting (FA) mechanoreceptors and a piezoresistive sensing layer to achieve the functionality of slow adapting (SA) mechanoreceptors. The tactile sensor has been demonstrated to be able to recognize voice and monitor physiological signals and human motions in a real-time manner. Combined with a machine learning framework, the tactile sensor is able to percept surface textures and material types with high accuracy. It is also demonstrated as an effective human-machine interface for the control of assistive robotics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, digitization has opened up various possibilities in the healthcare sector. Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient's health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient's body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient's body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient's body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient's discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient's body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The use of wearables is increasing and data from these devices could improve the prediction of changes in glycemic control. We conducted a randomized trial with adults with prediabetes who were given either a waist-worn or wrist-worn wearable to track activity patterns. We collected baseline information on demographics, medical history, and laboratory testing. We tested three models that predicted changes in hemoglobin A1c that were continuous, improved glycemic control by 5% or worsened glycemic control by 5%. Consistently in all three models, prediction improved when (a) machine learning was used vs. traditional regression, with ensemble methods performing the best; (b) baseline information with wearable data was used vs. baseline information alone; and (c) wrist-worn wearables were used vs. waist-worn wearables. These findings indicate that models can accurately identify changes in glycemic control among prediabetic adults, and this could be used to better allocate resources and target interventions to prevent progression to diabetes. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events—bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)—from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56–64.66 and 40.19–72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06–48.42, 40.19–72.70 and 36.06–60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Smart sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled remote automated monitoring (RAMs), can free a nurse from the task of in-person patient monitoring during the transportation process of patients between different wards in hospital settings. Automation of hospital beds using advanced robotics and sensors has been a growing trend exacerbated by the COVID crisis. In this exploratory study, a polynomial regression (PR) machine learning (ML) RAM algorithm based on a Dreyfusian descriptor for immediate wellbeing monitoring was proposed for the autonomous hospital bed transport (AHBT) application. This method was preferred over several other AI algorithm for its simplicity and quick computation. The algorithm quantified historical data using supervised photoplethysmography (PPG) data for 5 min just before the start of the autonomous journey, referred as pre-journey (PJ) dataset. During the transport process, the algorithm continued to quantify immediate measurements using non-overlapping sets of 30 PPG waveforms, referred as in-journey (IJ) dataset. In combination, this algorithm provided a binary decision condition that determined if AHBT should continue its journey to destination by checking the degree of polynomial (DoP) between PJ and IJ. Wrist PPG was used as algorithm’s monitoring parameter. PPG data was collected simultaneously from both wrists of 35 subjects, aged 21 and above in postures mimicking that in AHBT and were given full freedom of upper limb and wrist movement. It was observed that the top goodness-of-fit which indicated potentials for high data accountability had 0.2 to 0.6 cross validation score mean (CVSM) occurring at 8th to 10th DoP for PJ datasets and 0.967 to 0.994 CVSM at 9th to 10th DoP for IJ datasets. CVSM was a reliable metric to pick out the best PJ and IJ DoPs. Central tendency analysis showed that coinciding DoP distributions between PJ and IJ datasets, peaking at 8th DoP, was the precursor to high algorithm stability. Mean algorithm efficacy was 0.20 as our proposed algorithm was able to pick out all signals from a conscious subject having full freedom of movement. This efficacy was acceptable as a first ML proof of concept for AHBT. There was no observable difference between subjects’ left and right wrists. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Simultaneous monitoring of human motion and collecting ambient energy are important for the development of personal healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. Here, a flexible and stretchable coaxial triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) yarn is designed and fabricated by using coil spring as the inner support layer and mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite as the outer friction layer. By weaving coaxial TENG yarns, or mix-weaving with other yarns, a multifunctional TENG fabric can be manufactured for energy harvesting external mechanical energy from human motion or ambient environment. More important, it can self-powered sense human motion in both electrical (through TENG) and optical (from mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite) methods. This work provides a new strategy for wearable TENG fabrics with dual-mode sensing and energy harvesting which have potential applications in long-term medical monitoring and human-machine interaction systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Skin-inspired flexible wearable acceleration sensors attract much attention due to their advantages of portability, personalized and comfortable experience, and potential application in healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, and physical sports performance evaluation. This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island–bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper presents a heart disease prediction model. Among the recent technology, internet of thingsenabled healthcare plays a vital role. The medical sensors used in healthcare provide a huge volume of medical data in a continuous manner. The speed of data generation in IoT healthcare is high so the volume of data is also high. In order to overcome this problem, the proposed model is a novel threestep process to store and analyze the large volumes of data. The first step focuses on a collection of data from sensor devices. In Step 2, HBase has been used to store the large volume of medical sensor data from a wearable device to the cloud. Step 3 uses Mahout for devolving logistic regression-based prediction model. At last, ROC curve is used to find the parameters that cause heart disease. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Patient gesture recognition is a promising method to gain knowledge and assist patients. Healthcare monitoring systems integrated with the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm to perform the remote solutions for the acquiring inputs. In recent years, wearable sensors, and information and communication technologies are assisting for remote monitoring and recommendations in smart healthcare. In this paper, the dependable gesture recognition (DGR) using a series learning method for identifying the action of patient monitoring through remote access is presented. The gesture recognition systems connect to the end-user (remote) and the patient for instantaneous gesture identification. The gesture is recognized by the analysis of the intermediate and structuring features using series learning. The proposed gesture recognition system is capable of monitoring patient activities and differentiating the gestures from the regular actions to improve the convergence. Gesture recognition through remote monitoring is indistinguishable due to the preliminary errors. Further, it is convertible using series learning. Therefore, the misdetections and classifications are promptly identified using the DGR and verified by comparative analysis and experimental study. From the analysis, the proposed DGR approach attains 94.92% high precision for the varying gestures and 89.85% high accuracy for varying mess factor. The proposed DGR reduces recognition time to 4.97 s and 4.93 s for the varying gestures and mess factor, respectively. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Background and objective: E-health is a growing research topic, especially with the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT). Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. Methods: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions. Conclusions: The proposed design constitutes a digital clinical tool for medical teams allowing remote health monitoring. It overcomes geographical barriers while providing faster and highly accurate assessment. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because of the rapid and serious nature of acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) especially ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a leading cause of death worldwide, prompt diagnosis and treatment is of crucial importance to reduce both mortality and morbidity. During a pandemic such as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), it is critical to balance cardiovascular emergencies with infectious risk. In this work, we recommend using wearable device based mobile health (mHealth) as an early screening and real-Time monitoring tool to address this balance and facilitate remote monitoring to tackle this unprecedented challenge. This recommendation may help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of acute CVD patient management while reducing infection risk.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Human Activity Recognition (HAR) that includes gait analysis may be useful for various rehabilitation and telemonitoring applications. Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - A dual-channel single-mode-multi-mode-single-mode (SMS) fiber optic sensor encapsulated by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was proposed for the first time, for the simultaneous monitoring of the brachial and radial arteries for accurate blood pressure prediction. With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate. The blood pressure monitoring system has the characteristics of low cost, high sensitivity, non-invasive and capability for remote real time monitoring, which can provide effective solution for intelligent health monitoring in the era of artificial intelligence in the future. © 1983-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic manifested the need of developing robust digital platforms for facilitating healthcare services such as consultancy, clinical therapies, real time remote monitoring, early diagnosis and future predictions. Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - COVID-19 is a life-threatening contagious virus that has spread across the globe rapidly. To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively. Moreover, significant improvement has been registered for proposed fog-cloud-based data analysis in terms of Temporal Delay efficacy, Precision, and F-measure. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Modern wearable healthcare devices require new technologies with resource efficiency in terms of high performance, low energy consumption and diagnostic accuracy. In the field of artificial intelligence, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has performed as an effective algorithm. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively utilised to construct hardware accelerators for CNNs. This paper suggests using an accelerator to create a specific 1-D CNN to classify the electrogram (ExG). ExGs used here include electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram and electromyography. The pipelined structure is designed with a register in the middle to facilitate easy data transfer. A 1-D CNN using an accelerator to categorise ExG signals implemented on Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 platform outperforms FPGA peer applications on the same platform by 1.14× in terms of speed. In addition, the 1-D CNN proposed accelerator operates very efficiently due to the use of a tristate buffer in the multiplexer and the substitution of the shift for the multiplier, resulting in a resource-efficient accelerator with 161 GOP/s/W energy efficiency and 28 GOP/s/KLUT, an improvement of 1.67 over the previous model. Finally, the performance of the accelerator applied to a Xilinx Zynq xc7z045 FPGA operating at 442.948MHz was calculated, achieving 1.145 TFLOP/s. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the “Internet of Medical Things” (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Development of predictive computational models of metabolism through mechanistic models is complex and resource demanding, and their personalization remains challenging. Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As more and more medical devices, including as mobile phones, sensors, and remote monitoring equipment, require Internet access, wireless networks have gained considerable traction in the healthcare sector. High-performance technologies, such as the forthcoming fifth generation/sixth generation (5G/6G), are needed for data transit to and from medical equipment in order to give patients with state-of-the-art medical treatments. Furthermore, much better optimization techniques must be used when creating its primary components. Intelligent system design affects how all medical equipment operates, which presents a challenging issue in medical applications. Using information from many sources, electronic health records are built and stored there. These data are compiled in several formats and techniques. There are various big data strategies that could be utilised to reconcile the conflicting data. Artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning methods can be used to forecast diseases or other problems using the knowledge gathered from big data analytics. With the advent of 5G, augmented reality, virtual reality and spatial computing are all enhanced, which has a profound effect on healthcare informatics by allowing for real-time remote monitoring. With the advent of 5G technologies, healthcare services can be provided over vast distances via a vast network of interconnected devices and high-performance computation. Disease detection and treatment using dynamic data can be accomplished with the help of deep learning techniques such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN). Deep convolutional neural networks that incorporate images of sick regions are frequently employed for classification tasks. © 2022 Kohat University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Patients with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) are at a high risk of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The use of remote ICD monitoring, wearable devices, and patient-reported outcomes generate large volumes of potential valuable data. Artificial intelligence–based methods can be used to develop personalized prediction models and improve early-warning systems. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop an integrated web-based personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Methods: This international, multicenter, prospective, observational study consists of 2 phases: (1) a development study and (2) a feasibility study. We plan to enroll 400 participants with an ICD (with or without cardiac resynchronization therapy) on remote monitoring: 300 participants in the development study and 100 in the feasibility study. During 12-month follow-up, electronic health record data, remote monitoring data, accelerometry-assessed physical behavior data, and patient-reported data are collected. By using machine- and deep-learning approaches, a prediction engine is developed to assess the risk probability of ICD therapy (shock and antitachycardia pacing). The feasibility of the prediction engine as a clinical tool, the SafeHeart Platform, is assessed during the feasibility study. Results: Development study recruitment commenced in 2021. The feasibility study starts in 2022. Conclusion: SafeHeart is the first study to prospectively collect a multimodal data set to construct a personalized prediction engine for ICD therapy. Moreover, SafeHeart explores the integration and added value of detailed objective accelerometer data in the prediction of clinical events. The translation of the SafeHeart Platform to clinical practice is examined during the feasibility study. © 2021 Heart Rhythm Society

AB  - Purpose: Parkinson’s Disease comes on top among neurodegenerative diseases affecting 10 million worldwide. To detect Parkinson’s Disease in a prior state, gait analysis is an effective choice. However, monitoring of Parkinson’s Disease using gait analysis is time consuming and exhaustive for patients and physicians. To assess severity of symptoms, a rating scale called Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is used. It determines mild and severe cases. Today, Parkinson’s Disease severity assessment is made in gait laboratories and by manual examination. These are time consuming and it is costly for health institutions to build and maintain laboratories. By using low-cost wearables and an effective model, aforementioned problems can be solved. Methods: We provide a computerized solution for quantifiable assessment of Parkinson’s Disease symptoms severity. By using wearable sensors, our framework can predict exact symptom values to assess Parkinson’s Disease severity. We propose a deep learning approach that utilizes Ground Reaction Force sensors. From sensor signals, features are extracted and fed to a hybrid deep learning model. This model is the combination of Convolutional Neural Networks and Locally Weighted Random Forest. Results: Proposed framework achieved 0.897, 3.009, 4.556 in terms of Correlation Coefficient, Mean Absolute Error and Root Mean Square Error, respectively. Proposed framework outperformed other machine and deep learning models. We also evaluated classification performance for disease detection. We outperformed most of the previous studies, achieving 99.5% accuracy, 98.7% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity. Conclusion: This is the first study to use a deep learning regression approach to predict exact symptom value of Parkinson’s Disease patients. Results show that this approach can be effectively employed as a disease severity assessment tool using wearable sensors. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Recently, Telehealth connects patients to vital healthcare services via remote monitoring, wireless communications, videoconferencing, and electronic consults. By increasing access to specialists and physicians, telehealth assists in ensuring patients receive the proper care at the right time and right place. Teleophthalmology is a study of telemedicine that provides services for eye care using digital medical equipment and telecommunication technologies. Multimedia computing with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) for telehealth has the potential to revolutionize various aspects of our society, but several technical challenges should be resolved before this potential can be realized. Advances in artificial intelligence methods and tools reduce waste and wait times, provide service efficiency and better insights, and increase speed, the level of accuracy, and productivity in medicine and telehealth. Therefore, this study develops an XAI-enabled teleophthalmology for diabetic retinopathy grading and classification (XAITO-DRGC) model. The proposed XAITO-DRGC model utilizes OphthoAI IoMT headsets to enable remote monitoring of diabetic retinopathy (DR) disease. To accomplish this, the XAITO-DRGC model applies median filtering (MF) and contrast enhancement as a pre-processing step. In addition, the XAITO-DRGC model applies U-Net-based image segmentation and SqueezeNet-based feature extractor. Moreover, Archimedes optimization algorithm (AOA) with a bidirectional gated recurrent convolutional unit (BGRCU) is exploited for DR detection and classification. The experimental validation of the XAITO-DRGC method can be tested using a benchmark dataset and the outcomes are assessed under distinct prospects. Extensive comparison studies stated the enhancements of the XAITO-DRGC model over recent approaches. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of innovative healthcare methods, including remote patient monitoring. In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate. While only a pilot phase study, the CDI represents a promising application of machine learning within a continuous remote patient monitoring system. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.  ©

AB  - COVID-19 exerts deleterious cardiopulmonary effects, leading to a worse prognosis in the most affected. This retrospective multi-center observational cohort study aimed to analyze the trajectories of key vitals amongst hospitalized COVID-19 patients using a chest-patch wearable providing continuous remote patient monitoring of numerous vital signs. The study was conducted in five COVID-19 isolation units. A total of 492 COVID-19 patients were included in the final analysis. Physiological parameters were measured every 15 min. More than 3 million measurements were collected including heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cardiac output, cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, respiratory rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature. Cardiovascular deterioration appeared early after admission and in parallel with changes in the respiratory parameters, showing a significant difference in trajectories within sub-populations at high risk. Early detection of cardiovascular deterioration of COVID-19 patients is achievable when using frequent remote patient monitoring. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Intelligent color-changing textiles have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. To realize the active modulation of color via sunlight, the photothermochromic fabric that adjusts its color based on the photothermal conversion performance of the sunlight-responsive heating layer under irradiation of solar is fabricated by double-side coating. Depending on the light absorption at 350–2500 nm, the sunlight-responsive photothermochromic fabric (SPTCF) exposed under the irradiation power density of 500 W m−2 for 4 min displays efficient photothermal conversion, resulting in the increase in temperature from room temperature (23.0 °C) to above 47.0 °C. Simultaneously, the color of SPTCF changes from blue to white and returns to blue once the light is turned off for 3 min, indicating the sensitive and reversible photothermochromic property of the SPTCF. Compared with the contrast layer, the sunlight-responsive heating layer exhibits a rapid photothermal conversion speed and high optical contrast under the same irradiation condition. The heating/cooling curves show steady signals after mechanical deformations and 150 cycles, revealing the favorable durability of the SPTCF under the solar irradiation. The sensitive photothermochromic properties promote the application of the SPTCF in smart wearable fields. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The rapid development of communication technologies and expert systems have resulted in a large volume of medical data. Big data such as clinical data, omics data, and electronic health data are difficult to manage in real-time due to noise, large size, different formats, missing values and large features. Hence, it is more difficult for the health monitoring system to extract the correct information. Low quality and noisy data can lead to unnecessary treatment. To overcome these issues, we proposed Enriched Salp Swarm Optimization based Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (ESSOBiLSTM) to monitor health. This method consists of four layers, such as the data collection layer, data storage layer, data analytics, and presentation layer. The initial layer handles a variety of information from main sources: wearable sensor devices (WSD), social network data, and medical records (MR). The second layer stores all the collected data from WSD, MR, and social network data to the cloud server through the wireless network. The proposed framework for performing big data analytics steps like preprocessing, filtering, dimensionality reduction, and classification is performed in the third layer. In the final layer, the doctor analyzes the patient's condition based on the classification results of the enriched SSO-BiLSTM. Based on the evaluation report, the proposed ESSOBiLSTM gives an accuracy of 85%, precision of 80%, RMSE of 0.6, MAE of 0.58, recall of 85% and F-measure of 79%. As a result, ESSOBiLSTM has proven to be more effective in monitoring health in large datasets. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - In the past few years, remote monitoring technologies have grown increasingly important in the delivery of healthcare. According to healthcare professionals, a variety of factors influence the public perception of connected healthcare systems in a variety of ways. First and foremost, wearable technology in healthcare must establish better bonds with the individuals who will be using them. The emotional reactions of patients to obtaining remote healthcare services may be of interest to healthcare practitioners if they are given the opportunity to investigate them. In this study, we develop an artificial intelligence-based classification system that aims to detect the emotions from the input data using metaheuristic feature selection and machine learning classification. The proposed model is made to undergo series of steps involving preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. The simulation is conducted to test the efficacy of the model on various features present in a dataset. The results of simulation show that the proposed model is effective enough to classify the emotions from the input dataset than other existing methods.  © 2022 Gouse Baig Mohammad et al.

AB  - Remote monitoring of physical frailty is important to personalize care for slowing down the frailty process and/or for the healthy recovery of older adults following acute or chronic stressors. Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the global Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) industry has evolved at a tremendous speed. Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0. The purpose of this study is to construct a secure health monitoring system in healthcare 5.0 by utilizing a blockchain technology and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect any malicious activity in a healthcare network and enables physicians to monitor patients through medical sensors and take necessary measures periodically by predicting diseases. The proposed system demonstrates that the approach is optimized effectively for healthcare monitoring. In contrast, the proposed healthcare 5.0 system entangled with FL Approach achieves 93.22% accuracy for disease prediction, and the proposed RTS-DELM-based secure healthcare 5.0 system achieves 96.18% accuracy for the estimation of intrusion detection. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects millions of people each year. It is associated with an increased likelihood of vital organ failures and decreased quality of life. Early detection and regular monitoring are crucial for managing diabetes. Remote patient monitoring can facilitate effective intervention and treatment paradigms using current technology. This work proposes an end-to-end remote monitoring framework for automated diabetes risk prediction and management, using personal health devices, smart wearables and smartphones. A support vector machine was developed for diabetes risk prediction using the Pima Indian Diabetes Database, after feature scaling, imputation, selection and augmentation. This work achieved the performance metrics of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity scores at 83.20%, 87.20% and 79% respectively through the tenfold stratified cross validation method, which is competitive with existing methods. Patients can use multiple healthcare devices, smartphones and smartwatches to measure vital parameters, curb the progression of diabetes and close the communication loop with medical professionals. The proposed framework enables medical professionals to make informed decisions based on the latest diabetes risk predictions and lifestyle insights while attaining unobtrusiveness, reduced cost, and vendor interoperability. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - To avoid dire situations, the medical sector must develop various methods for quickly and accurately identifying infections in remote regions. The primary goal of the proposed work is to create a wearable device that uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to carry out several monitoring tasks. To decrease the amount of communication loss as well as the amount of time required to wait before detection and improve detection quality, the designed wearable device is also operated with a multi-objective framework. Additionally, a design method for wearable IoT devices is established, utilizing distinct mathematical approaches to solve these objectives. As a result, the monitored parametric values are saved in a different IoT application platform. Since the proposed study focuses on a multi-objective framework, state design and deep learning (DL) optimization techniques are combined, reducing the complexity of detection in wearable technology. Wearable devices with IoT processes have even been included in current methods. However, a solution cannot be duplicated using mathematical approaches and optimization strategies. Therefore, developed wearable gadgets can be applied to real-time medical applications for fast remote monitoring of an individual. Additionally, the proposed technique is tested in real-time, and an IoT simulation tool is utilized to track the compared experimental results under five different situations. In all of the case studies that were examined, the planned method performs better than the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, flexible wearable electronic devices have attracted immense interest as an alternative for conventional rigid metallic conductors in personal healthcare monitoring, human motion detection, and sensory skins, owing to their intrinsic characteristics. However, the practical applications of most wearable sensors are generally limited by their poor stretchability and sensitivity, unsatisfactory strength, lower conductivity, and single sensory function. Here a hydrogen bond cross-linked network based on carboxylic styrene butadiene rubber (XSBR) and hydrophilic sericin (SS) non-covalently modified carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is rationally designed and then fabricated into multi-functional sensors. The resultant versatile sensors are able to detect both weak and large deformations, which owns a low detection limit of 1% strain, high stretchability up to 217%, superior strength of 12.58 MPa, high sensitivity with a gauge factor up to 25.98, high conductivity of 0.071 S m−1, and lower percolation threshold of 0.504 wt%. Moreover, the prepared sensors also possess an impressively thermal response (0.01636 °C−1) and realize the application in the measurement of human body temperature. The multifunctional and scalable XSBR/SSCNT sensor with the integrated tracking capabilities of real-time and in situ physiological signals, providing a promising route to develop wearable artificial intelligence in human health and sporting applications. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Academics and the health community are paying much attention to developing smart remote patient monitoring, sensors, and healthcare technology. For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Various Human Activities are classified through time-series data generated by the sensors of wearable devices. Many real-time scenarios such as Healthcare Surveillance, Smart Cities and Intelligent surveillance etc. are based upon Human Activity Recognition. Despite the popularity of local features-based approaches and machine learning approaches, it fails to capture adequate temporal information. In this paper, the deep convolutional neural model has been proposed by combining external features, i.e. orientation invariant (||v||) and consecutive point trajectory information (||Δ v||) with tri-axis data of the accelerometer. The proposed external features based approach experimented on three different deep learning architecture, namely Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Convolution Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Accuracy of the algorithms radically improve with the additional input feature ||v|| and ||Δ v|| along with tri-axis data of accelerometer. The results show that the performance of all three LSTM, CNN and ConvLSTM models is better to compare with the state of art methods on WISDOM dataset and Activity dataset also the performance of ConvLSTM is 98.41% for WISDOM dataset and 98.04 for activity dataset, which is higher than that of CNN and LSTM model used in this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Stair climb power (SCP) is a clinical measure of leg muscular function assessed in-clinic via the Stair Climb Power Test (SCPT). This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0–6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3–6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment.

AB  - In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.  © 2022 Alwin Poulose et al.

AB  - Efficient remote monitoring of the patient infected with coronavirus without spread to healthcare workers is the need of the hour. An effectual and faster communication system must be established wherein the healthcare workers at the remote quarantine ward can communicate with healthcare professionals present in specialty hospitals. Incidentally, there is a need to establish a contactless smart cloud-based connection between a specialty hospital and quarantine wards during pandemic situation. This paper proposes an initial contactless web-based tele-health clinical decision support system that integrates near-field communication (NFC) tags and a smart cloud-based structuring tool that enables the quick diagnosis of patients with COVID-19 symptoms and monitors the remotely located quarantine wards during the recent pandemic. The proposed framework consists of three-stages: (i) contactless health parameter extraction from the patient using an NFC tag; (ii) converting medical report into digital text using optical character recognition algorithm and extracting values of relevant medical-parameters using natural language processing; and (iii) smart visualization of key medical parameters. The accuracy of the proposed system from NFC reader until analysis using a novel structuring algorithm deployed in the cloud is more than 94%. Several capabilities of the proposed web-based system were compared with similar systems and tested in an authentic mock clinical setup, and the physicians found that the system is reliable and user friendly.

AB  - The development of flexible electronic skins with high performance and multifunctional sensing capabilities is of great significance for applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to artificial intelligence. To mimic and surpass the high-gauge-factor sensing properties of human skin, structure design and appropriate material selection of sensors are both essentially required. Here, we present an efficient, low-cost fabrication strategy to construct an ultra-highly sensitive, flexible pressure sensor by embedding the aligned nickel-coated carbon fibers (NICFs) in a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Our design substantially contributes to ultrahigh sensitivity through the parallel circuit formed by aligned NICFs as well as surface spinosum microstructure molded by sandpaper. As a result, the sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (15â »525 kPa-1), a fast response time (30 ms), and good stability over 3000 loading-unloading cycles. Furthermore, these superior sensing properties trigger applications in water quality and wave monitoring in conjunction with mechanical flexibility and robustness. As a precedent for adjusting the sensitivities of the sensor, the NICFs/PDMS sensor provides a promising method for multiscenario healthcare monitoring, multiscale pressure spatial distribution, and human-machine interfacing.  ©

AB  - Blood pressure issues are related to many illnesses threatening human health and require continuous control and monitoring. Health telemonitoring is an innovative solution allowing wellbeing and increasing autonomy of patients. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are a viable method used in recent studies for analyzing, predicting, and classifying health data while improving the health conditions of telemonitoring and telediagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely. The first layer of the proposed architecture performs BP measurement, classification, and transmission to the second layer using a wearable sensor. The learning of classifiers is established with Cross-Validation to avoid over-fitting and to improve the performance while comparing the Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier. An experimental trial is carried out and the timing of 49 seconds is reached between BP measurement and the display of data on the IoT platform. Besides, the system was tested in real-time trials and produced an accurate classification of each measured BP. The obtained results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of BP measurement, analysis, transmission, and supervision in real-time. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Nowadays, the technological advancements of low power electronic and sensing devices, wearable systems, communication technologies, and cloud computing have encouraged the provision of ubiquitous health monitoring, medical diagnosis, and treatment consultations. The data collected from the patients are transmitted to mHealth server for real-time and self-reliant activity detection, behavior analysis, ambient assisted living, elderly care, activity of daily living, rehabilitations, entertainments, and surveillance in smart home environments. This helps in building sensor analyst systems that analyze the data on mHealth server for disseminating it to the respective end users. This is of utmost importance as it can provide real time feedback to patients, family members, caregivers, and so forth about the behavioral changes of elderly people and people with special needs. In this article, we have proposed knowledge based data dissemination system using machine learning techniques that analyses the data collected on mHealth server in three steps. First, the data are analyzed using support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, neural network, and logistic regression. Second, it finds hidden patterns from the data using hidden Markov model (HMM). Third, it defines fuzzy rules to disseminate the data to the end users. The system has been compared against conventional approaches. The uniqueness of the system lies in the fact that it uses temporal nature of data and provides with real-time feedback as well as predicts outcomes and detects hidden patterns. The results have shown that the techniques NN, HMM, and fuzzy logic when used in conjunction with each other for disease prediction, hidden pattern detection, and data dissemination gives an accuracy of 98%. Thus, increasing effectiveness of sensor analyst system. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Current developments in sensors and actuators are heralding a new era to facilitate things to happen effortlessly and efficiently with proper communication. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) has been boomed up with er potential and occupies a wide range of disciplines. This study has choreographed to design of an algorithm and a smart data-processing scheme to implement the obtained data from the sensing system to transmit to the receivers. Technically, it is called “telediagnosis” and “remote digital monitoring,” a revolution in the field of medicine and artificial intelligence. For the proof of concept, an algorithmic approach has been implemented for telediagnosis with one of the degenerative diseases, that is, Parkinson's disease. Using the data acquired from an improved interdigitated electrode, sensing surface was evaluated with the attained sensitivity of 100 fM (n = 3), and the limit of detection was calculated with the linear regression value coefficient. By the designed algorithm and data processing with the assistance of IoT, further validation was performed and attested the coordination. This proven concept can be ideally used with all sensing strategies for immediate telemedicine by end-to-end communications. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - Health sector is a life critical domain, which requires fast and intelligent decisions. Artificial intelligence-based monitoring systems can help the elderly people in situations like fall. In e-health, systems are equipped with wearable devices that aid in remote monitoring with the help of Internet of Things (IoT). Our proposed work ensures fall detection using a three-layer architecture (Edge-Fog-Cloud) which takes advantage of the available smart devices. The edge detection involves vision-based detection using a compressed neural network running on a smart device constructed using transfer learning. Decision making in fog involves ensemble learning methodology using sensor-based data and decision from the edge. The cloud is used for permanent storage and model building. The work also takes advantage of image augmentation for data set building to improve the performance of the model. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, and the advantage of the fog layer is evaluated based on the latency. The proposed model gives an accuracy of 98.5% which is compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms available for detection.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - A continuous heart disease monitoring system is one of the significant applications specified by the Internet of Things (IoT). This goal might be achieved by combining sophisticated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experiment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contributions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart disease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring system. The simulation outcomes proved that the recommended approach is more successful at predicting heart illness than existing technologies. © 2022 Nalecz Institute of Biocybernetics and Biomedical Engineering of the Polish Academy of Sciences

AB  - A soft bending sensor based on the inverse pyramid structure is demonstrated, revealing that it can effectively suppress microcrack formation in designated regions, thus allowing the cracks to open gradually with bending in a controlled manner. Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2∼0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated. Such features of our bending sensor will enable a simple and effective way of detecting sophisticated motion, thus potentially advancing wearable healthcare monitoring electronics and enabling proprioceptive soft robotics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Undiagnosed malnutrition is a significant problem in high-income countries, which can reduce the quality of life of many individuals, particularly of older adults. Moreover, it can also inflate the costs of existing health care systems because of the many metabolic complications that it can cause. The current methods for assessing malnutrition can be cumbersome. A trained practitioner must be present to conduct an assessment, or patients must travel to facilities with specialized equipment to obtain their measurements. Therefore, digital health care is a possible way of closing this gap as it is rapidly gaining traction as a scalable means of improving efficiency in the health care system. It allows for the remote monitoring of nutritional status without requiring the physical presence of practitioners or the use of advanced medical equipment. As such, there is an increasing interest in expanding the range of digital applications to facilitate remote monitoring and management of health issues. In this study, we discuss the feasibility of a novel digital remote method for diagnosing malnutrition using facial morphometrics. Many malnutrition screening assessments include subjective assessments of the head and the face. Facial appearance is often used by clinicians as the first point of qualitative indication of health status. Hence, there may be merit in quantifying these subtle but observable changes using facial morphometrics. Modern advancements in artificial intelligence, data science, sensors, and computing technologies allow facial features to be accurately digitized, which could potentially allow these previously intuitive assessments to be quantified. This study aims to stimulate further discussion and discourse on how this emerging technology can be used to provide real-time access to nutritional status. The use of facial morphometrics extends the use of currently available technology and may provide a scalable, easily deployable solution for nutritional status to be monitored in real time. This will enable clinicians and dietitians to keep track of patients remotely and provide the necessary intervention measures as required, as well as providing health care institutions and policy makers with essential information that can be used to inform and enable targeted public health approaches within affected populations. © Wesley Tay, Rina Quek, Bhupinder Kaur, Joseph Lim, Christiani Jeyakumar Henry.

AB  - The hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring, and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions. Our work shed a new light on the development of eco-friendly wearable sensor for the personalized healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Healthcare systems recognize and are trying to alleviate a common and rapidly growing psychological illness called stress. Stress detection is becoming the most valuable task of the healthcare industry. Thus, much research is being conducted in this domain. With the wide use of chest- and wrist-worn devices as part of the smart healthcare system utilizing emerging information technologies such as big data, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, it is becoming easier to collect the relevant data and to interpret them correctly. This research aimed to evaluate and analyze the popular stress detection dataset Wearable Stress and Affect Detection (WESAD) using the RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform (ROCKET) technique. Such technique was selected due to its ability to extract multiple features for the classification process without losing important data. The classification process utilizes the linear ridge classifier, and the results obtained from the use of the ROCKET technique in this study were compared to the previously published results of the successfully performed previous studies in this domain. The ROCKET technique showed satisfactory performance with 87% accuracy, close to and within the range of the results obtained from the algorithms that were previously applied on the WESAD dataset. The study results show the great potential of the ROCKET technique, which can be further improved by utilizing different existing classifiers or by proposing new models based on ridge or logistic regression. © 2021, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.

AB  - Background: Although many electrocardiography wearable devices have been released recently for the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF), there are few studies reporting prospective data for wearable devices compared to the strategy of the existing guidelines in the detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) after cryptogenic stroke. A tiny single-patch monitor is more convenient than a conventional Holter monitor recording device and, therefore, longer duration of monitoring may be acceptable. Methods and Design: The CANDLE-AF study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial. Patients with transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke without any history of AF will be enrolled. The superiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to standard strategy and non-inferiority of the 72-h single-patch monitor to an event-recorder-type device will be investigated. Single-patch monitor arm will repeat monitoring at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, event-recorder-type arm will repeat monitoring twice daily for 12 months. The enrollment goal is a total of 600 patients, and the primary outcome is the detection of AF which continues at least 30 s during study period. The secondary outcome is the rate of changes from antiplatelet to anticoagulant and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events within 1 year. Conclusions: The results of CANDLE-AF will clarify the role of a single-lead patch ECG for the early detection of AF in patients with acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the secondary outcome will be analyzed to determine whether more sensitive AF detection can affect the prognosis and if further device development is meaningful.

AB  - Patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may deteriorate rapidly and therefore continuous monitoring is necessary. We conducted an observational study involving patients with mild COVID-19 to explore the potentials of wearable biosensors and machine learning-based analysis of physiology parameters to detect clinical deterioration. Thirty-four patients (median age: 32 years; male: 52.9%) with mild COVID-19 from Queen Mary Hospital were recruited. The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%). Wearable biosensors coupled with machine learning-derived health index allowed automated detection of clinical deterioration. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - A smart city is an intelligent space, in which large amounts of data are collected and analyzed using low-cost sensors and automatic algorithms. The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively. Finally, we present an application to show how MicroNN can improve the development of sustainable and smart cities.  © 2022 Jin Wu et al.

AB  - Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article. Copyright © 2022 Quanyu E.

In the healthcare industry, Internet of Things (IoT) driven fog computing is being developed to speed up the services for the general public and save billions of lives. This new computing platform, based on the fog computing paradigm, may reduce latency when transmitting and communicating signals with faraway servers, allowing medical services to be delivered more quickly in both spatial and temporal dimensions. One of the necessary qualities of computing systems that can enable the completion of healthcare operations is latency reduction. Fog computing can provide reduced latency when compared to cloud computing due to the use of only low-end computers, mobile phones, and personal devices in fog computing. In this paper, a new framework for healthcare monitoring for managing real-Time notification based on fog computing has been proposed. The proposed system monitors the patient's body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained from the sensors that are embedded into a wearable device and notifies the doctors or caregivers in real time if there occur any contradictions in the normal threshold value using the machine learning algorithms. The notification can also be set for the patients to alert them about the periodical medications or diet to be maintained by the patients. The cloud layer stores the big data into the cloud for future references for the hospitals and the researchers. © 2022 Ahmed Elhadad et al.

AB  - Urinalysis is attractive in non-invasive early diagnosis of bladder cancer compared with clinical gold standard cystoscopy. However, the trace bladder tumor biomarkers in urine and the particularly complex urine environment pose significant challenges for urinalysis. Here, a clinically adoptable urinalysis device that integrates molecular-specificity indium gallium zinc oxide field-effect transistor (IGZO FET) biosensor arrays, a device control panel, and an internet terminal for directly analyzing five bladder-tumor-associated proteins in clinical urine samples, is reported for bladder cancer diagnosis and classification. The IGZO FET biosensors with engineered sensing interfaces provide high sensitivity and selectivity for identification of trace proteins in the complex urine environment. Integrating with a machine-learning algorithm, this device can identify bladder cancer with an accuracy of 95.0% in a cohort of 197 patients and 75 non-bladder cancer individuals, distinguishing cancer stages with an overall accuracy of 90.0% and assessing bladder cancer recurrence after surgical treatment. The non-invasive urinalysis device defines a robust technology for remote healthcare and personalized medicine. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - A methodology for daily physical activity tracking, detection, and classification is proposed using wearable ultrawideband (UWB) technology. The compact UWB antennas act as sensors to provide useful information and metrics regarding the activity, derived from channel information (path loss and rms delay spread) and received signal features. The activities consist of daily activities, such as walking, sitting, running, opening/closing door, and ascending/descending stairs, which are considered as main activities in everyday life. Experimental validation is carried out showing effective tracking capabilities based on the interdistance variation, giving an estimate of the range of movement during various phases of the activity cycle. The computation of patterns of different daily activities cycle provides unique recognition/classification characteristics, which have been validated through template-based and machine learning techniques. The proposed method provides high accuracy, is cost-effective, and has low computation complexity, making it suitable for various healthcare applications, such as elderly/remote monitoring, rehabilitation, patient activity tracking, and general fitness.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper employs a unique sensor fusion (SF) approach to detect a COVID-19 suspect and the enhanced MobileNetV2 model is used for face mask detection on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform. The SF algorithm avoids incorrect predictions of the suspect. Health data are continuously monitored and recorded on the ThingSpeak cloud server. When a COVID-19 suspect is detected, an emergency email is sent to healthcare personnel with the GPS position of the suspect. A lightweight and fast deep learning model is used to recognize appropriate mask positioning; this restricts virus transmission. When tested with the real-world masked face dataset (RMFD) dataset, the enhanced MobileNetV2 neural network is optimal for Raspberry Pi. Our IoT device and deep learning model are 98.50% (compared to commercial devices) and 99.26% accurate, respectively, and the time required for face mask evaluation is 31.1 milliseconds. The proposed device is useful for remote monitoring of covid patients. Thus, the method will find medical application in the detection of COVID-19-positive patients. The device is also wearable. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Following the standardization and deployment of the 5G network, researchers have shifted their focus to beyond 5G (B5G) communication. Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication. These intelligent walls, equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and computation power, would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation health care in the era of B5G.  © 1990-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Pulse signal is one of the most important physiological features of human body, which is caused by the cyclical contraction and diastole. It has great research value and broad application prospect in the detection of physiological parameters, the development of medical equipment, and the study of cardiovascular diseases and pulse diagnosis objective. In recent years, with the development of the sensor, measuring and saving of pulse signal has become very convenient. Now the pulse signal feature analysis is a hotspot and difficulty in the signal processing field. Therefore, to realize pulse signal automatic analysis and recognition is vital significance in the aspects of the noninvasive diagnosis and remote monitoring, etc. In this article, we combined the pulse signal feature extraction in time and frequency domain and convolution neural network to analyze the pulse signal. Firstly, a theory of wavelet transform and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) which is gradually developed in recent years have been used to remove the noises in the pulse signal. Moreover, a method of feature point detection based on differential threshold method is proposed which realized the accurate positioning and extraction time-domain values. Finally, a deep learning method based on one-dimensional CNN has been utilized to make the classification of multiple pulse signals in the article. In conclusion, a deep learning method is proposed for the pulse signal classification combined with the feature extraction in time and frequency domain in this article.  © 2022 Quanyu E.

AB  - Background: Abnormal prolongation or shortening of the QT interval is associated with increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. For continuous monitoring, widespread use, and prevention of cardiac events, advanced wearable technologies are emerging as promising surrogates for conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) QT interval assessment. Previous studies have shown a good agreement between QT and corrected QT (QTc) intervals measured on a smartwatch ECG and a 12-lead ECG, but the clinical accuracy of computerized algorithms for QT and QTc interval measurement from smartwatch ECGs is unclear. Objective: The prospective observational study compared the smartwatch-recorded QT and QTc assessed using AccurKardia’s AccurBeat platform with the conventional 12-lead ECG annotated manually by a cardiologist. Methods: ECGs were collected from healthy participants (without any known cardiovascular disease) aged >22 years. Two consecutive 30-second ECG readings followed by (within 15 minutes) a 10-second standard 12-lead ECG were recorded for each participant. Characteristics of the participants were compared by sex using a 2-sample t test and Wilcoxon rank sum test. Statistical comparisons of heart rate (HR), QT interval, and QTc interval between the platform and the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II were done using the Wilcoxon sign rank test. Linear regression was used to predict QTc and QT intervals from the ECG based on the platform’s QTc/QT intervals with adjustment for age, sex, and difference in HR measurement. The Bland-Altman method was used to check agreement between various QT and QTc interval measurements. Results: A total of 50 participants (32 female, mean age 46 years, SD 1 year) were included in the study. The result of the regression model using the platform measurements to predict the 12-lead ECG measurements indicated that, in univariate analysis, QT/QTc intervals from the platform significantly predicted QT/QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG, ECG lead I, and ECG lead II, and this remained significant after adjustment for sex, age, and change in HR. The Bland-Altman plot results found that 96% of the average QTc interval measurements between the platform and QTc intervals from the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% confidence limit of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –10.5 (95% limits of agreement –71.43, 50.43). A total of 94% of the average QT interval measurements between the platform and the 12-lead ECG were within the 95% CI of the average difference between the two measurements, with a mean difference of –6.3 (95% limits of agreement –54.54, 41.94). Conclusions: QT and QTc intervals obtained by a smartwatch coupled with the platform’s assessment were comparable to those from a 12-lead ECG. Accordingly, with further refinements, remote monitoring using this technology holds promise for the identification of QT interval prolongation. ©Sara Chokshi, Gulzhan Tologonova, Rose Calixte, Vandana Yadav, Naveed Razvi, Jason Lazar, Stan Kachnowski.

AB  - Novel means to minimize treatment delays in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are needed. Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2–90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 »000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.  ©

AB  - Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Parkinson’s disease medication treatment planning is generally based on subjective data obtained through clinical, physician-patient interactions. The Personal KinetiGraph™ (PKG) and similar wearable sensors have shown promise in enabling objective, continuous remote health monitoring for Parkinson’s patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to use objective sensor data from the PKG and apply machine learning to cluster patients based on levodopa regimens and response. The resulting clusters are then used to enhance treatment planning by providing improved initial treatment estimates to supplement a physician’s initial assessment. We apply kmeans clustering to a dataset of within-subject Parkinson’s medication changes—clinically assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and the PKG sensor for movement staging. A random forest classification model was then used to predict patients’ cluster allocation based on their respective demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data. Clinically relevant clusters were partitioned by levodopa dose, medication administration frequency, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose—with the PKG providing similar symptomatic assessments to physician MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A random forest classifier trained on demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data was able to accurately classify subjects of the two most demographically similar clusters with an accuracy of 86.9%, an F1 score of 90.7%, and an AUC of 0.871. A model that relied solely on demographic information and PKG time-series data provided the next best performance with an accuracy of 83.8%, an F1 score of 88.5%, and an AUC of 0.831, hence further enabling fully remote assessments. These computational methods demonstrate the feasibility of using sensor-based data to cluster patients based on their medication responses with further potential to assist with medication recommendations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: We developed a wearable watch-based device to provide noninvasive, cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation in an at-home setting. Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible and wearable pressure sensors have gained great popularity in consumer electronics due to their potential applications in human healthcare, E-skin, and artificial intelligence interactions. MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Sensor-based human activity recognition (S-HAR) has become an important and high-impact topic of research within human-centered computing. In the last decade, successful applications of S-HAR have been presented through fruitful academic research and industrial applications, including for healthcare monitoring, smart home controlling, and daily sport tracking. However, the growing requirements of many current applications for recognizing complex human activities (CHA) have begun to attract the attention of the HAR research field when compared with simple human activities (SHA). S-HAR has shown that deep learning (DL), a type of machine learning based on complicated artificial neural networks, has a significant degree of recognition efficiency. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are two different types of DL methods that have been successfully applied to the S-HAR challenge in recent years. In this paper, we focused on four RNN-based DL models (LSTMs, BiLSTMs, GRUs, and BiGRUs) that performed complex activity recognition tasks. The efficiency of four hybrid DL models that combine convolutional layers with the efficient RNN-based models was also studied. Experimental studies on the UTwente dataset demonstrated that the suggested hybrid RNN-based models achieved a high level of recognition performance along with a variety of performance indicators, including accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix. The experimental results show that the hybrid DL model called CNN-BiGRU outperformed the other DL models with a high accuracy of 98.89% when using only complex activity data. Moreover, the CNN-BiGRU model also achieved the highest recognition performance in other scenarios (99.44% by using only simple activity data and 98.78% with a combination of simple and complex activities). © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) - including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics - as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives: Artificial intelligence and big data are more and more used in medicine, either in prevention, diagnosis or treatment, and are clearly modifying the way medicine is thought and practiced. Some authors argue that the use of artificial intelligence techniques to analyze big data would even constitute a scientific revolution, in medicine as much as in other scientific disciplines. Moreover, artificial intelligence techniques, coupled with mobile health technologies, could furnish a personalized medicine, adapted to the individuality of each patient. In this paper we argue that this conception is largely a myth: what health professionals and patients need is not more data, but data that are critically appraised, especially to avoid bias. Methods: In this historical and conceptual article, we focus on two main problems: first, the data and the problem of its validity; second, the inference drawn from the data by AI, and the establishment of correlations through the use of algorithms. We use examples from the contemporary use of mobile health (mHealth), i.e. the practice of medicine and public health supported by mobile or wearable devices such as mobile phones or smart watches. Results: We show that the validity of the data and of the inferences drawn from these mHealth data are likely to be biased. As biases are insensitive to the size of the sample, even if the sample is the whole population, artificial intelligence and big data cannot avoid biases and even tend to increase them. Conclusions: The large amount of data thus appears rather as a problem than a solution. What contemporary medicine needs is not more data or more algorithms, but a critical appraisal of the data and of the analysis of the data. Considering the history of epidemiology, we propose three research priorities concerning the use of artificial intelligence and big data in medicine. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The rapid progress in advanced functional fibers (AFFs) offers unique superiorities in wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, and healthcare monitoring. However, there remain considerable challenges for AFFs to fulfill specific requirements of advanced applications due to their low electrical outputs, limitation in materials selection, and difficulty in regulating microstructures on narrow and curved surface of the fibers. In this study, fabricating and regulating honeycomb porous microstructures (HPMs) on one-dimensional nonplanar fiber surfaces were proposed and systematically studied for developing AFFs with customized functionalities. As a demonstration of application, multifunctional silver-plated nylon fibers surface-engineered with HPMs (SNF@HPMs) were developed with the assistance of the BF method and were further fabricated into SNF@HPMs-based triboelectric nanogenerator (SNF@HPMs-TENG). The SNF@HPMs-TENG showed considerable electrical performances with a power density of 390.8 mW/m2 and good long-term stability, which can power portable electronics as capacitors, calculator, watch, and light up 150 LEDs. Moreover, a self-powered wearable sensor based on SNF@HPMs was also developed for monitoring the bending, tactile, and frictional stimuli in a real-time manner. The comprehension of HPMs mechanism on nonplanar fiber surface and demonstrated capability of the SNF@HPMs-TENG provide insights and guidance in regulating microstructures of fiber materials for developing AFFs with customizable functionalities. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In medical practices, the detection of diseases highly depends on different medical tests. Electrocardiogram (ECG) technique is commonly used for heart disease diagnosis. Doctors can measure pulse and other heart boundaries with the aid of it. Fast and precise detection of forms of arrhythmia is critical while identifying heart disease. In this work, we proposed an intelligent ECG device (called iKardo) with the built-in automatic capability to classify into critical and non-critical data from an imbalanced ECG dataset for the smart IoT or Internet of Things based smart healthcare device. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of data misclassification by converting imbalanced data into a balanced dataset using necessary techniques. This proposed iKardo helps in the accurate detection of critical ECG beats with an accuracy of 99.58% and result in a smart healthcare monitoring device that would make the disease detection fast and precise.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - With the advent of advanced materials processing techniques, and physical sensors’ output data acquisition, transmission and processing by embedded systems through internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc., tools are opened up many possibilities in distributed healthcare monitor, robotic process automation, smart home, etc., domains. To further augment the efficiency of these applications wearable sensors, electronic skin, smart sensors, etc., were fabricated with a variety of materials combination. Among many sensors, temperature, pressure and volume (plethysmo) sensors are widely used in healthcare to monitor vital signs: body temperature(BT), heart rate (HR), blood pressure(BP), respiration rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (Osat). These readings are called vital signs because they all must be present for life to continue. Vital signs measurement by wearable tactile/ pressure sensors for healthcare monitor are most widely researched in the recent years due to their promising application in a distributed healthcare system. Hence, it is important to understand both the basics of vital signs and their measurement by various transduction based tactile sensors in details to devise a suitable sensor for vital signs monitor. In the literature, there are many research articles on vital signs monitor by pressure sensors with qualitative data and, some times, exaggerated claims of measurements and suitability of a sensor for specific vital sign measurement. However, for real applications one need quantitative parameters of a sensor for a particular application. Thus it may worth to separate the wheat from the chaff by studying the fundamentals of vital signs, measurement requirements and limitations of measuring techniques etc., in details. This information is missing in the literature. Hence we have systematically presented the various electrical transduction based tactile or pressure sensor technologies, sensor fabrication methods, sensor characteristics modification, basics of vital signs, and measurement techniques. The past three years literature on respective vital sign measurement were also presented here. It is inferred that the tactile sensor should be highly sensitive in linear working range of 30–190 mmHg (4–25 kPa) to measure blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. However, the required sensitivity value is not yet determined for each of the above measurements, in the literature. Both resistance and capacitance tactile sensors’ sensitivity and linear working range can be enhanced by employing biomimetic surface microstructures, 3D porous microstructures, intrafillable microstructures, metallic fillers, ionic liquids, etc., The details of each method is described in the article under suitable section. It is still a great challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, wide linear working range, excellent stability in a sensor for meeting the requirements of full-scale healthcare monitoring from subtle deformations (due to blood pulse, and cheek occlusion) to large deformations (due to finger bending and pressing). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The goal of wearable patches in the healthcare system is to eliminate the conventional health care system. It is achieved by detecting data received from sensor nodes using IoT technology and processing it using a strategy for remote patient monitoring based on machine learning. This is as the data transmission is carried out by a sensor in the network, which utilises the power backup of the nodes. Even successful ways of data collection from several nodes in smart wearable patches and data aggregation may reduce the network’s power supply. Therefore, the heuristic algorithm opportunistic power optimum performance algorithm (OP2A) is employed to increase the sensor nodes’ lifetime in the healthcare system. This eliminates unnecessary data loops between network patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured in terms of network lifetime, latency in sensing data, throughput, and error metrics. In addition, the gateway manages the service and communicates with the data server using the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP). Using self-trained models, the suggested machine learning approach predicts the health state. This gets rid of any unnecessary data loops between the network’s wearable patches, and the algorithm’s effectiveness is measured by the network’s lifespan, how long it takes to sense data, how much data it can handle, and how many errors it makes. © 2022, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Background: The number of solid organ transplants in Canada has increased 33% over the past decade. Hospital readmissions are common within the first year after transplant and are linked to increased morbidity and mortality. Nearly half of these admissions to the hospital appear to be preventable. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies hold promise to reduce admission to the hospital and improve patient outcomes, as they allow real-Time monitoring and timely clinical intervention. Objective: This study aims to determine whether an innovative mHealth intervention can reduce hospital readmission and unscheduled visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic. Our second objective is to assess the use of clinical and continuous ambulatory physiologic data to develop machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of infection, organ rejection, and early mortality in adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Methods: Remote Mobile Outpatient Monitoring in Transplant (Reboot) 2.0 is a two-phased single-center study to be conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, Canada. Phase one will consist of a 1-year concealed randomized controlled trial of 400 adult heart, kidney, and liver transplant recipients. Participants will be randomized to receive either personalized communication using an mHealth app in addition to standard of care phone communication (intervention group) or standard of care communication only (control group). In phase two, the prior collected data set will be used to develop machine learning algorithms to identify early markers of rejection, infection, and graft dysfunction posttransplantation. The primary outcome will be a composite of any unscheduled hospital admission, visits to the emergency department or transplant clinic, following discharge from the index admission. Secondary outcomes will include patient-reported outcomes using validated self-Administered questionnaires, 1-year graft survival rate, 1-year patient survival rate, and the number of standard of care phone voice messages. Results: At the time of this paper s completion, no results are available. Conclusions: Building from previous work, this project will aim to leverage an innovative mHealth app to improve outcomes and reduce hospital readmission in adult solid organ transplant recipients. Additionally, the development of machine learning algorithms to better predict adverse health outcomes will allow for personalized medicine to tailor clinician-patient interactions and mitigate the health care burden of a growing patient population. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc.

AB  - High-performance wearable electronics show great potential in the soft robotics, artificial intelligence, human–machine interaction, health care, etc. Due to the wide application in heart rate detection, voice monitoring, and sports data collection, the pressure sensor has grasped a lot of attention. However, poor cycle stability, low sensitivity and narrow working pressure range hinder the further development of the pressure sensors. To solve the above mentioned problems, a polyurethane-based conductive sponge is prepared via silver nanoparticle coating after the in-situ synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) on the backbones of polyurethane foam. The flexible pressure sensor exhibits excellent performance, including ultrahigh sensitivity (3.039 kPa−1), wide working range (0–35 kPa), frequency-independent performance, reliable repeatability (~ 1000 cycles), rapid and stable response. Finally, we successfully demonstrated these flexible sensors in detecting tiny physiological activities and human motions. All the results demonstrate that the the polyurethane-based pressure sensor is a promising candidate for soft electronics and healthcare monitoring. © 2021, The Polymer Society, Taipei.

AB  - Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a new virus of viral pneumonia. It can outbreak in the world through person-to-person transmission. Although several medical companies provide cooperative monitoring healthcare systems, these solutions lack offering of the end-to-end management of the disease. The main objective of the proposed framework is to bridge the current gap between current technologies and healthcare systems. The wireless body area network, cloud computing, fog computing, and clinical decision support system are integrated to provide a comprehensive and complete model for disease detection and monitoring. By monitoring a person with COVID-19 in real time, physicians can guide patients with the right decisions. The proposed framework has three main layers (i.e., a patient layer, cloud layer, and hospital layer). In the patient layer, the patient is tracked through a set of wearable sensors and a mobile app. In the cloud layer, a fog network architecture is proposed to solve the issues of storage and data transmission. In the hospital layer, we propose a convolutional neural network-based deep learning model for COVID-19 detection based on patient’s X-ray scan images and transfer learning. The proposed model achieved promising results compared to the state-of-the art (i.e., accuracy of 97.95% and specificity of 98.85%). Our framework is a useful application, through which we expect significant effects on COVID-19 proliferation and considerable lowering in healthcare expenses. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - High-performance stretchable and wearable electronic skins (e-skins) with high sensitivity and large sensing range are urgently required with the rapid development of internet of things and artificial intelligence. Herein, a simple and efficient “dip coating” method was proposed for preparing flexible pressure sensors based on the combination of silicone rubber (SR) and carbonized melamine sponge (CMS). From the as-prepared flexible sensor, good stability, mechanical performances, anti-interference ability, wide working range (0–550 kPa), fast response (~120 ms), frequency-dependent performance, reliable repeatability (~10000 cycle) and stable signal waveform output can be readily obtained. This CMS-based flexible pressure sensor can not only detect human motion (finger bending, knee squatting-arising and plantar pressure changing) in real time and reliably, but also detect the pressure distribution in space through arraying. The experimental results demonstrate that the flexible pressure sensor based on functional-sponge can be a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable electronics in artificial intelligence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully. This work has high potential in the field of health telemonitoring.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Wearable electronic textiles are used in sensors, energy-harvesting devices, healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and soft robotics to acquire real-time big data for machine learning and artificial intelligence. Wearability is essential while collecting data from a human, who should be able to wear the device with sufficient comfort. In this study, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and silver nanowires (AgNWs) were supersonically sprayed onto a fabric to ensure good adhesiveness, resulting in a washable, stretchable, and wearable fabric without affecting the performance of the designed features. This rGO/AgNW-decorated fabric can be used to monitor external stimuli such as strain and temperature. In addition, it is used as a heater and as a supercapacitor and features an antibacterial hydrophobic surface that minimizes potential infection from external airborne viruses or virus-containing droplets. Herein, the wearability, stretchability, washability, mechanical durability, temperature-sensing capability, heating ability, wettability, and antibacterial features of this metallized fabric are explored. This multifunctionality is achieved in a single fabric coated with rGO/AgNWs via supersonic spraying. ©

AB  - In this paper we proposed a wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) telemonitoring system for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection based on a smartphone and cloud computing. A wearable ECG patch was designed to collect ECG signals and send the signals to an Android smartphone via Bluetooth. An Android APP was developed to display the ECG waveforms in real time and transmit every 30 s ECG data to a remote cloud server. A machine learning (CatBoost)-based ECG classification method was proposed to detect AF in the cloud server. In case of detected AF, the cloud server pushed the ECG data and classification results to the web browser of a doctor. Finally, the Android APP displayed the doctor’s diagnosis for the ECG signals. Experimental results showed the proposed CatBoost classifier trained with 17 selected features achieved an overall F1 score of 0.92 on the test set (n = 7270). The proposed wearable ECG monitoring system may potentially be useful for long-term ECG telemonitoring for AF detection. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Flexible and portable pressure sensors with highly sensitive and cost-effective attributes are of great demand in wearable electronics, biomedical monitoring, and artificial intelligence. To realize portable pressure sensors with mobile operation, ultrathin, flexible, and sustainable power sources are highly desired. Here, a self-powered wearable pressure sensing system is developed by integrating a conductive elastomer-based pressure sensor with a flexible thin-film thermoelectric generator (tf-TEG) to harvest body heat. Laser engraving technique is adopted to achieve pressure sensor with tunable sensitivity through the controllable design of surface microstructures. To produce a reliable and renewable power supply for the pressure sensor, the flexible tf-TEG is constructed with high thermal-conductivity insulation films for heat absorbing and flexible hydrogels as heat sink, resulting in a large temperature gradient for high power generation. In particular, the pressure sensitivity of the self-powered system is independent of the temperature gradient across the tf-TEG, allowing it to maintain a stable performance under various temperature differences between human skin and surroundings. For the first time, the self-powered pressure sensing system proposed in this work enables continuous monitoring of human physiological signals and body motions entirely powered by the skin-attachable tf-TEG without an electronic boost circuitry. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to gather human and environment information data for a variety of intelligent services and applications. Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the massive progress of Internet of Things based technologies, the importance of remote monitoring has increased by many folds especially for the assistance of patients suffering from life threatening diseases. This work deals with the detection of Freezing of Gait in patients having Parkinson's disease with the help of wearable acceleration sensors placed on their legs and hips which consequently results in their real-time remote monitoring. This work proposes a FoG detection method based on Grey Relational Analysis which uses the readings from the sensors to predict the presence or absence of freezing in a patient. Additionally, an ensemble learning approach that uses Grey Relational Analysis as the base classification model has also been illustrated for FoG detection. The proposed approaches have been applied on benchmark Daphnet Freezing of Gait data set to verify their feasibility. The simulation results show that the proposed approaches have better accuracy when compared to other existing machine learning techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Long-term blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a widely used approach in a homecare intelligent system. However, BP is usually measured using cuff-based devices with tedious operation in practice, which may not be cost effective for continuous BP tracking. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based multitask network with a weighting scheme for BP estimation by analyzing and modeling single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve mean error of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure estimation in levels of 0.18 $\pm$ 10.83, 1.24 $\pm$ 5.90, and 0.84 $\pm$ 6.47 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population. © 2005-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible, wearable and breathable pressure sensors have received tremendous interest for various potential applications in wearable electronic skins, intelligent robotics, healthcare biomonitoring, and artificial intelligence. However, it remains a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, broad sensing range, excellent mechanical stability, fast response/recovery, and reliable breathability for long-term wearing for ultrasensitive comfortable full-scale biomonitoring. Herein, we present a wearable, highly sensitive, broad-range and breathable pressure sensor by sandwiching the interconnected nanocomposites of carbonized metal-organic framework (C-MOF) and polyaniline nanofiber (PANIF) on polyurethane (PU) sponge (C-MOF/PANIF@PU) between a breathable fabric and an interdigitated electrode-coated fabric. The assembled sensor exhibits a broad sensing range (up to 60 kPa), high sensitivity (158.26 kPa−1), fast response/recovery time (22 ms/20 ms), reliable breathability, wireless biomonitoring, and an excellent repeatability over 15,000 cycles. It can be assembled as smart artificial electronic skins (E-skins) for mapping tactile stimuli. This work paves the way for the design of wearable, breathable, highly sensitive and broad-range pressure sensor with potential versatile applications in next-generation artificial skins, personal healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnosis, and human-machine interactions. © 2020

AB  - Background: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions are based on clinical grading methods, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers, paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and dispatches to appropriate medical centers. Objective: In this study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of 4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by medical staff. Methods: We implemented an automatic grading system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological examination and demographic information of stroke patients with NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of data between classes and low number of training data. We trained 2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30 trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). Results: The proposed system can grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912 using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7% and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of 78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification. Conclusions: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation. © Eunjeong Park, Kijeong Lee, Taehwa Han, Hyo Suk Nam.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) is making strong advances in healthcare with the promise of transformation in technological, social and economic prospects, paving the way for a healthy future. Medical devices equipped with wireless communication enable remote monitoring features and are increasingly becoming connected to each other and to the Internet. Such smart and connected medical devices referred to as the Internet of Medical Things have enabled continuous real-time patient monitoring, increase in diagnostic accuracy, and effective treatment. In spite of their numerous benefits, these devices open up newer attack surfaces thereby introducing multitude of security and privacy concerns. Attacks on Internet connected medical devices can potentially cause significant physical harm and life-threatening damage to the patients. In this research, we design and develop a novel mobile agent based intrusion detection system to secure the network of connected medical devices. In particular, the proposed system is hierarchical, autonomous, and employs machine learning and regression algorithms to detect network level intrusions as well as anomalies in sensor data. We simulate a hospital network topology and perform detailed experiments for various subsets of Internet of Medical things including wireless body area networks and other connected medical devices. Our simulation results demonstrate that we are able to achieve high detection accuracy with minimal resource overhead. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - With the rapid development in smart medical devices, internet of things has a large applicability in the healthcare sector. The current system is based on a centralized communication with cloud servers. However, this architecture increases security and privacy risks. This paper describes an architecture of a smart healthcare system for remote patient monitoring. To ensure security and privacy, the architecture uses blockchain technology. For data analysis, smart contracts and artificial intelligence are used. The architecture is divided into three layers: smart medical devices layer, fog layer, and cloud layer. To validate the proposed approach, a scenario based on diabetes management system is described. The architecture is applied to provide remote diabetic patient monitoring. The system could suggest treatments, generate proactive predictions, and predict future complications as well as alerting physicians in case of emergency. © 2021 IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the Healthcare 4.0 era, recent breakthroughs in emerging and disruptive technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), machine learning and robotics, have significantly changed the way in which healthcare services are delivered to patients. Advancements in patient monitoring systems and wearable devices have created more powerful and flexible real-time remote patient observation. Healthcare provision has experienced remarkable improvements facilitated by cloud computing and wireless technologies, while wireless sensor networks now play an important role in mobile technologies for e-healthcare. In this paper, we propose a mobile-based healthcare system for the Healthcare 4.0 era. The proposed approach enables patients to self-authenticate, using their own mobile and wearable devices, establishing a session key between owned devices. After mutual authentication, the cloud server verifies each user. The security of the approach is described through the AVISPA tool. We analyze the embedded security and functionality which improves the healthcare system and calculate the relative communication and computation costs. Results show that the proposed approach provides greater security compared to other state-of-the-art schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Wearable electronics and smart garments have attracted increasing attention due to their potential application in health care monitoring, artificial intelligence, soft robotics, etc. However, designing robust and flexible wearable electronics that can shield electromagnetic waves and work in all-weather environment or even harsh conditions remains a challenge. Herein, superhydrophobic and multi-responsive fabric composites with outstanding electro-photo-thermal effect and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) performance are fabricated by decoration of conductive Ag nanoparticles onto the oxygen plasma treated polypropylene (PP) fabric, followed by multiple spray-coating with a mixture of Fe3O4 nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The obtained fabric composites exhibit high conductivity (up to 108.8 S/cm) and the EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) can reach as high as ~56.1 dB in the X band, in which of the incident electromagnetic waves can account for 30%. Moreover, the PDMS coating not only improves the interface adhesion between the nanoparticles and fibers, but also endows the fabric composites with superhydrophobicity, leading to an excellent self-cleaning performance. Surprisingly, the fabric composites also exhibit multiple responsive properties to electron and light, known as electro-photo-thermal effect, which can be maintained during mechanical deformations and cold environment. This work opens a new avenue for next-generation of wearable electronics with multi-functionality. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the invent of medical expert systems, the demand for efficient innovative techniques in signal processing to detect abnormalities is ever increasing for identifying heart-related problems. The major objective of this research is to offer medical services to people in remote villages at low cost. People in villages and remote areas do not have a facility to get treated by a medical expert. This research provides them an opportunity to get medical advice through the virtual environment called the VH-doctor machine. It is a virtual environment heart doctor and reduces the human effort in testing and treating of heart diseases at the initial stages. The patients are treated and diagnosed only with the help of machines but not human effort. Biomedical sensors, ARM processor and FPGA are used to detect, test, analyze and display normal or abnormal cases. In this research, ECG signal processing, feature extraction and KNN classifier are performed and achieve the highest accuracy of 99% better than other machine learning algorithms. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to provide a model for prediction of respiratory symptoms in the progression of COVID-19, social distancing, frequent hand washes, wearing of face mask in public are some of the potential measures of preventing the disease from further spreading. In spite of the effects and efforts taken by governments, the pandemic is still uncontrolled in major cities of the world. The proposed technique in this paper introduces a non-intrusive and major screening of vital symptoms and changes in the respiratory organs. Design/methodology/approach: The novel coronavirus or Covid-19 has become a serious threat to social and economic growth of many nations worldwide. The pace of progression was significantly higher in the past two months. Identified by severe respiratory illness, fever and coughs, the disease has been threatening the lives of human society. Early detection and prognosis is absolutely necessary to isolate the potential spreaders of the disease and to control the rate of progression. Findings: Recent studies have highlighted the changes observed in breathing characteristics of infected patients. Respiratory pattern of Covid-19 patients can be differentiated from the respiratory pattern of normal cold/flu affected patients. Tachypnoea is one among the vital signs identified to be distinguishing feature of Covid-19. The proposed respiratory data capture will commence with facial recognition, use of infrared sensors and machine-learning approaches to classify the respiratory patterns, which finally narrows down as a symptom of Covid-19. Originality/value: Proposed system produced outcome of 94% accuracy, precision, recall and a F1-measure as an average in the conducted experiments. This method also proves to be a fruitful solution for large-scale monitoring and categorisation of people based on the symptoms. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The increasing popularity of wearable consumer products can play a significant role in the healthcare sector. The recognition of human activities from IoT is an important building block in this context. While the analysis of the generated datastream can have many benefits from a health point of view, it can also lead to privacy threats by exposing highly sensitive information. In this article, we propose a framework that relies on machine learning to efficiently recognise the user activity, useful for personal healthcare monitoring, while limiting the risk of users re-identification from biometric patterns characterizing each individual. To achieve that, we show that features in temporal domain are useful to discriminate user activity while features in frequency domain lead to distinguish the user identity. We then design a novel protection mechanism processing the raw signal on the user's smartphone to select relevant features for activity recognition and normalise features sensitive to re-identification. These unlinkable features are then transferred to the application server. We extensively evaluate our framework with reference datasets: Results show an accurate activity recognition (87%) while limiting the re-identification rate (33%). This represents a slight decrease of utility (9%) against a large privacy improvement (53%) compared to state-of-the-art baselines. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Nano-scaled structures, wireless sensing, wearable devices, and wireless communications systems are anticipated to support the development of new next-generation technologies in the near future. Exponential rise in future Radio-Frequency (RF) sensing systems have demonstrated its applications in areas such as wearable consumer electronics, remote healthcare monitoring, wireless implants, and smart buildings. In this paper, we propose a novel, non-wearable, device-free, privacy-preserving Wi-Fi imaging-based occupancy detection system for future smart buildings. The proposed system is developed using off-the-shelf non-wearable devices such as Wi-Fi router, network interface card, and an omnidirectional antenna for future body centric communication. The core idea is to detect presence of person along its activities of daily living without deploying a device on person's body. TheWi-Fi signals received using non-wearable devices are converted into time-frequency scalograms. The occupancy is detected by classifying the scalogram images using an auto-encoder neural network. In addition to occupancy detection, the deep neural network also identifies the activity performed by the occupant. Moreover, a novel encryption algorithm using Chirikov and Intertwining map-based is also proposed to encrypt the scalogram images. This feature enables secure storage of scalogram images in a database for future analysis. The classification accuracy of the proposed scheme is 91.1%. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) and machine learning based systems incorporating smart wearable technology are rapidly evolving to monitor and manage healthcare and physical activities. This paper is focused on the proposition of a fog-centric wireless, real-time, smart wearable and IoT-based framework for ubiquitous health and fitness analysis in a smart gym environment. The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data. The purpose of the GAR module is to collect and analyze exercise specific data. The GAR module achieved an accuracy of above 89% on athlete independent model based on muscle group.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the explosive development of smart wearable devices, a serious situation that a large amount of energy waste and environmental pollution caused by electronic discarding needs to be solved urgently. Here, as a throwaway waste material, a chewed gum can be reused for the preparation of wearable iontronics simply. A new gum sensor was constructed by regularly stretching a chewed gum in 6 M NaCl aqueous or even a Chinese edible salt solution for increasing the ionic conductivity. This gum sensor can be shaped arbitrarily, and the preparation process is green, pollution-free, with low energy consumption, and repeatable. Herein, this gum sensor can be utilized for real-time human healthcare monitoring effectively (i.e., facial mood changes, finger flexion, long time walking, and continuous ankle movement) and shows a fast response time of 297 ms and a reliable cycling performance in monitoring body motions. Furthermore, the gum sensor (containing edible salt) can act as a signal transmitter for intelligent information encryption and transmission in the light of the international Morse code with excellent repeatability and stability. Hence, this work will greatly possess wide potential application prospects in wearable electronics and information encryption. This gum sensor also provides a ponderable option in the next generation of artificial intelligence devices, which can address the troubles of material selections in sensor preparation. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - The real-time monitoring and tracking systems play a critical role in the healthcare field. Wearable medical devices with sensors, mobile applications, and health cloud have continuously generated an enormous amount of data, often called streaming big data. Due to the higher speed of the streaming data, it is difficult to ingest, process, and analyze such huge data in real-time to make real-time actions in case of emergencies. Using traditional methods that are inadequate and time-consuming. Therefore, there is a significant need for real-time big data stream processing to guarantee an effective and scalable solution. So, we proposed a new system for online prediction to predict health status using Spark streaming framework. The proposed system focuses on applying streaming machine learning models (i.e. streaming linear regression with SGD) on streaming health data events ingested to spark streaming through Kafka topics. The experimental results are done on the historical medical datasets (i.e. diabetes dataset, heart disease dataset, and breast cancer dataset) and generated dataset which is simulated to wearable medical sensors. The historical datasets have shown that the accuracy improvement ratio obtained using the diabetes disease dataset is the highest one with respect to the other two datasets with an accuracy of 81%. For generated datasets, the online prediction system has achieved accuracy with 98% at 5 seconds window size. Beyond this, the experimental results have proofed that the online prediction system can online learn and update the model according to the new data arrival and window size. © 2020, Science and Information Organization.

AB  - Flexible wearable conductive hydrogel-based epidermal sensors have attracted tremendous attention due to their versatile potential applications in soft robotics, personal healthcare monitoring and electronic skins. However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based epidermal sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability, self-adhesiveness and long-lasting moisture retention for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, a conductive, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel is prepared from the conformal coating of the MXene nanosheet network by the polymer networks of dopamine grafted sodium alginate (Alg-DA), phenylboronic acid grafted sodium alginate (Alg-PBA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) with a glycerol/water binary solvent as the dispersion medium. The obtained MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel exhibits excellent self-healing capability, superior self-adhesive performance and long-lasting moisture retention (10 days). Furthermore, the MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel can be assembled as a wearable epidermal sensor to detect human motion including large deformation (finger bending and wrist bending) and tiny deformation (swallowing, breathing, and pulse) with durable stability. Meanwhile, the assembled epidermal sensor could be employed to monitor human activities wirelessly via connecting a wireless transmitter. This work sheds new light on the development of flexible, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist epidermal sensors and electronic skins for personalized healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

AB  - Objective: Continuous temperature monitoring in high-risk patients can enable healthcare providers to remotely track patients' temperatures, promptly detect fevers and timely intervene to improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated if a novel wearable, continuous temperature monitor (Verily Patch) can reliably estimate body temperature and early detect fevers in an outpatient setting in patients at a high risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) who recently underwent chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). Methods: 86 patients at a high risk for FN were prospectively enrolled at Mayo Clinic, MN. Patients wore the device in their axilla region for 7 days post ASCT and recorded self-measured oral temperatures every 3 hours. Patients were also followed using clinical standard-of-care procedures with daily oral temperature assessment. The clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures were used to develop and evaluate Verily Patch's body temperature and early fever detection algorithms using a K-fold cross-validation approach. Results: The Verily Patch reliably measured body temperatures with an error of 0.35 ± 0.88°F in comparison to clinic-and patient-assessed oral temperatures. The sensitivity and specificity of the patch in detecting clinic-assessed fever episodes was 90.2% and 87.8%. The patch detected 14.3 times the number of clinic-assessed fever episodes with a median lead time of 4.3 hours. Conclusion: Patient self-monitoring of temperature and fever incidents suffers from low accuracy and is impractical for extended periods of time. Continuous temperature monitoring by a wearable device (such as Verily Patch) has the potential to overcome these challenges resulting in better patient clinical outcomes and more cost-effective care.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the increasing emphasis on remote electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring, a variety of wearable remote ECG monitoring systems have been developed. However, most of these systems need improvement in terms of efficiency, stability, and accuracy. In this study, the performance of an ECG monitoring system is optimized by improving various aspects of the system. These aspects include the following: the judgment, marking, and annotation of ECG reports using artificial intelligence (AI) technology; the use of Internet of Things (IoT) to connect all the devices of the system and transmit data and information; and the use of a cloud platform for the uploading, storage, calculation, and analysis of patient data. The use of AI improves the accuracy and efficiency of ECG reports and solves the problem of the shortage and uneven distribution of high-quality medical resources. IoT technology ensures the good performance of remote ECG monitoring systems in terms of instantaneity and rapidity and, thus, guarantees the maximum utilization efficiency of high-quality medical resources. Through the optimization of remote ECG monitoring systems with AI and IoT technology, the operating efficiency, accuracy of signal detection, and system stability have been greatly improved, thereby establishing an excellent health monitoring and auxiliary diagnostic platform for medical workers and patients.

AB  - Measurement of vital signs of the human body such as heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory rate is an important part of diagnosing medical conditions and these are usually measured using medical equipment. In this paper, we propose to estimate an important vital sign - heart rate from speech signals using machine learning algorithms. Existing literature, observation and experience suggest the existence of a correlation between speech characteristics and physiological, psychological as well as emotional conditions. In this work, we estimate the heart rate of individuals by applying machine learning based regression algorithms to Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, which represent speech features in the spectral domain as well as the temporal variation of spectral features. The estimated heart rate is compared with actual measurement made using a conventional medical device at the time of recording speech. We obtain estimation accuracy close to 94% between the estimated and actual measured heart rate values. Binary classification of heart rate as 'normal' or 'abnormal' is also achieved with 100% accuracy. A comparison of machine learning algorithms in terms of heart rate estimation and classification accuracy is also presented. Heart rate measurement using speech has applications in remote monitoring of patients, professional athletes and can facilitate telemedicine. © 2021 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.

AB  - Smart information systems are based on sensors that generate a huge amount of data. This data can be stored in cloud for further processing and efficient utilization. Anomalous data might be present within the sensor data due to various reasons (e.g., malicious activities by intruders, low quality sensors, and node deployment in harsh environments). Anomaly detection is crucial in some applications such as healthcare monitoring systems, forest fire information systems, and other internet of things (IoT) systems. This paper proposes a Gaussian distribution-based supervised machine learning scheme of anomaly detection (GDA) for healthcare monitoring sensor cloud, which is an integration of various body sensors of different patients and cloud. This work is implemented in Python. Use of Gaussian statistical model in the proposed scheme improves precision, throughput, and efficiency. GDA provides 98% efficiency with 3% and 4% improvements as compared to the other supervised learning-based anomaly detection schemes (e.g., support vector machine [SVM] and self-organizing map [SOM], respectively).

AB  - Advancement in sensor technologies has resulted in rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) applications for developing behavioral and physiological monitoring systems such as IoT-based student healthcare monitoring system. Nowadays, a growing number of students living alone scattered over wide geographical areas, and tracking their health function status is necessary. In this paper, an IoT-based student healthcare monitoring model is proposed to continuously check student vital signs and detect biological and behavioral changes via smart healthcare technologies. In this model, vital data are collected via IoT devices and data analysis is carried out through the machine learning methods for detecting the probable risks of student’s physiological and behavioral changes. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model meets the efficiency and proper accuracy for detecting the students’ condition. After evaluating the proposed model, the support vector machine has achieved the highest accuracy of 99.1% which is a promising result for our purpose. The results outperformed decision tree, random forest, and multilayer perceptron neural network algorithms as well. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The last decade has seen tremendous improvements in technologies for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) management, in particular the so-called artificial pancreas (AP), a wearable closed-loop device modulating insulin injection based on glucose sensor readings. Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the 'UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,' a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems. © 1993-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, AI(Artificial Intelligence) has achieved great development in modern society. More and more modern technologies are applied in surveillance and monitoring. Healthcare monitoring is growing ubiquitous in modern wearable devices, such as a smart watch, electrocardiogram (ECG) necklace, smart band. Many sensors are attached to these smart devices to record and monitor physiological signals caused by activities, and then propagated those recorded electrical data to be further processed to give health diagnosis, disease prevention or making a distress call automatically. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with a high occurrence in adult people and observed as an autonomous risk factor for circulatory problems such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. Numerous traditional neural network based methods have been developed to detect OSA, where these methods however could not provide the intended result because they rely on shallow network. In this paper, we propose an effective OSA detection based on Convolutional neural network. Our method first extracts features from Apnea-Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using RR-intervals (time interval from one R-wave to the next R-wave in an ECG signal) and then CNN model having three convolution layers and three fully connected layers is trained with extracted features and applied for OSA detection. The first two convolution layers are followed by batch normalization and pooling layer, and softmax is connected to the last fully connected layer to give final decision. Experimental results on extracted feature of Apnea-ECG signal reveal that our model have better results in terms of performance measure sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It is expected that the related technology can be applied into smart sensors, especially wearable devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The number of older people is increasing in many countries. By 2030, it is estimated that 15% of the overall population will be comprised of people aged 65 and above. Hence, the monitoring and tracking of elder activities to ensure they live an active life has become a major research topic in recent years. In this work, an elderly sub-activity tracking system is developed to detect the sub-activity of the elderly based on their physical activities and indoor location. The physical activities tracking system and indoor location system is combined in this project to enhance the context of the elderly activities (i.e. sub-activities as defined in this project). An indoor location system is developed by using bluetooth low energy (BLE) beacon and BLE scanners to measure the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) signal to detect the location of the elderly. The activity tracking is carried out via a waist wearable device worn by the elderly. Random forest and support vector machine (SVM) are used as machine learning classifiers to predict the activity and indoor location with an accuracy of 95.03% and 86.58%, respectively. The data from activity tracking and indoor location sub-systems will then be combined to derive the sub-activity and push to an online internet of things (IoT) platform for remote monitoring and notification. © 2021, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population. © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Falls are one of the leading causes of permanent injury and/or disability among the elderly. When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset. As an additional and secondary study, we implement a simple Deep Learning classifier based on this data to prove the system’s feasibility. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Wearable devices as medical technologies are becoming an integral part of our lives. Many research studies are dedicated to these devices and are mainly focused on providing personal analytics, measuring physical status, and acquiring physiological signals and parameters. These continuously evolving technologies play an important role in telemedicine. Telemedicine can be broadly defined as the use of advanced telecommunications technologies to support many medical activities, such as the diagnosis, the analysis of patient data, the improvement of disease management and the treatment in remote areas. In this article, we present ATTICUS (Ambient-intelligent Tele-monitoring and Telemetry for Incepting and Catering over hUman Sustainability), an innovative remote monitoring system for ambient-assisted living based on the analysis of vital and behavioral parameters. The ATTICUS system consists of two essential components: a smart wearable—in the form of a short singlet—made of innovative textile which allows the acquisition of real-time body signals, e.g., electrocardiogram (ECG), breathing wave, temperature, and a multi-level Decision Support System (DSS), a distributed software which integrates advanced machine learning methods to automatically detect anomalies. ATTICUS is capable of operating in different application scenarios. Especially, the system will support in-home and out-home monitoring, personal check-ups, and specialized check-ups. Thus, the system will positively impact the canonical medical practices allowing simultaneous and continuous monitoring of a large number of people.

AB  - The leading causes of death worldwide are chronic illnesses suchlike diabetes, Heart Disease (HD), cancer as well as chronic respiratory malady. It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via '3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise '2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - With the proliferation of intelligent services and applications authorized by artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things has penetrated into many aspects of our daily lives, and the medical field is no exception. The medical Internet of Things (MIoT) can be applied to wearable devices, remote diagnosis, mobile medical treatment, and remote monitoring. There is a large amount of medical information in the databases of various medical institutions. Nevertheless, due to the particularity of medical data, it is extremely related to personal privacy, and the data cannot be shared, resulting in data islands. Federated learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative artificial intelligence method, provides a solution. However, FL also involves multiple security and privacy issues. This paper proposes an adaptive Differential Privacy Federated Learning Medical IoT (DPFL-MIoT) model. Specifically, when the user updates the model locally, we propose a differential privacy federated learning deep neural network with adaptive gradient descent (DPFLAGD-DNN) algorithm, which can adaptively add noise to the model parameters according to the characteristics and gradient of the training data. Since privacy leaks often occur in downlink, we present differential privacy federated learning (DP-FL) algorithm where adaptive noise is added to the parameters when the server distributes the parameters. Our method effectively reduces the addition of unnecessary noise, and at the same time, the model has a good effect. Experimental results on real-world data show that our proposed algorithm can effectively protect data privacy.  © 2021 Lina Ni et al.

AB  - Recent advances in Internet-of-Things technology have opened the doors to new scenarios for biosensor applications. Flexibility, portability, and remote control and access are of utmost importance to move these devices to people's homes or in a Point-of-Care context and rapidly share the results with users and their physicians. In this paper, an innovative portable device for both quantitative and semi-quantitative electrochemical analysis is presented. This device can operate autonomously without the need of relying on other devices (e.g., PC, tablets, or smartphones) thanks to built-in Wi-Fi connectivity. The developed hardware is integrated into a cloud-based platform, exploiting the cloud computational power to perform innovative algorithms for calibration (e.g., Machine Learning tools). Results and configurations can be accessed through a web page without the installation of dedicated APPs or software. The electrical input/output characteristic was measured with a dummy cell as a load, achieving excellent linearity. Furthermore, the device response to five different concentrations of potassium ferri/ferrocyanide redox probe was compared with a bench-top laboratory instrument. No difference in analytical sensitivity was found. Also, some examples of application-specific tests were set up to demonstrate the use in real-case scenarios. In addition, Support Vector Machine algorithm was applied to semi-quantitative analyses to classify the input samples into four classes, achieving an average accuracy of 98.23%. Finally, COVID-19 related tests are presented and discussed. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In healthcare, physical activity can be monitored in two ways: self‐monitoring by the patient himself or external monitoring by health professionals. Regarding self‐monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long‐term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled the invention of smart health monitoring systems. These health monitoring systems can track a person's mental and physical wellness. Stress, anxiety, and hypertension are key causes of many physical and mental disorders. Age-related problems such as stress, anxiety, and hypertension necessitate specific attention in this setting. Stress, anxiety, and blood pressure monitoring can prevent long-term damage by detecting problems early. This will increase the quality of life and reduce caregiver stress and healthcare costs. Determine fresh technology solutions for real-time stress, anxiety, and blood pressure monitoring using discreet wearable sensors and machine learning approaches. This study created an automated artefact detection method for BP and PPG signals. It was proposed to automatically remove outlier points generated by movement artefacts from the blood pressure signal. Next, eleven features taken from the oscillometric waveform envelope were utilised to analyse the relationship between diastolic blood pressure (SBP) and systolic blood pressure (DBP). This paper validates a proposed computational method for estimating blood pressure. The proposed architecture leverages sophisticated regression to predict systolic and diastolic blood pressure values from PPG signal characteristics.  © 2021 Malik Bader Alazzam et al.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels as wearable devices meet the basic demands of mechanical flexibility and smart sensing. However, achieving a combination of adequate skin adhesion, long-term stability and visible human-sensor interface are still challengeable. Here, a simple and effective strategy was proposed to fabricate “all-in-one” hydrolyzed keratin protein-modified polyacrylamide composite hydrogel transducer. Hydrolyzed keratin endowed hydrogel with lower modulus and ultra-stretchability to minimize wearing-related tension and discomfort. Specially, robust skin adhesion was obtained to achieve precise sensing without delamination. Impressively, the hydrogel had high transparency and exhibited wide-range temperature tolerance (−20 °C to 50 °C). Besides, the hydrogel with stable conductivity was extremely sensitive to pressure and strain at a wide range. As a result, the obtained transducer could not only detect human motion, respiratory mode and vocal-cord vibration, but also identify handwriting and facial expression. This work shed a new light on the design of next-generation skin-like electronic devices with applications in human-machine interface, ionic skin, artificial intelligence and healthcare monitoring. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The IoT has applications in many areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, and agriculture, to name a few. Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The clinical assessment technology such as remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress for lower limb related ailments rely on the automatic evaluation of movement performed along with an estimation of joint angle information. In this paper, we introduce a transfer-learning based Long-term Recurrent Convolution Network (LRCN) named as 'MyoNet' for the classification of lower limb movements, along with the prediction of the corresponding knee joint angle. The model consists of three blocks- (i) feature extractor block, (ii) joint angle prediction block, and (iii) movement classification block. Initially, the model is end-to-end trained for knee joint angle prediction followed by transferring the knowledge of a trained model to the movement classification through transfer-learning approach making a memory and computationally efficient design. The proposed MyoNet was evaluated on publicly available University of California (UC) Irvine machine learning repository dataset of the lower limb for 11 healthy subjects and 11 subjects with knee pathology for three movements type-walking, standing with knee flexion movements and sitting with knee extension movements. The average mean absolute error (MAE) resulted in the prediction of joint angle for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology are 8.1 % and 9.2 % respectively. Subsequently, an average classification accuracy of 98.1 % and 92.4 % were achieved for healthy subjects and subjects with knee pathology, respectively. Interestingly, the significance of this study in itself is promising with substantial improvement in the performance compared to state-of-the-art methodologies. The clinical significance of such surface electromyography signals (sEMG) based movement recognition and prediction of corresponding joint angle system could be beneficial for remote monitoring of rehabilitation progress by the physiotherapist using wearables. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that the population over 65 years old in China exceeds 166 million accounting for 11.93% of the total population by the end of 2018. The importance and severity of taking care of the elderly are becoming increasingly prominent. High-quality and meticulous care for the daily life of the elderly needs helpful and advanced sciences and technologies. Smart geriatric nursing is a must. Basing on the professional knowledge of geriatric nursing, this paper proposes a framework of smart geriatric nursing which consists of three aspects of smart nursing: smart geriatric nursing in physical health using biosensor and advanced devices, smart geriatric nursing in mental health based on user profile, and smart geriatric nursing for daily life based on big data in health. The deployment of the proposed method relies on the technologies of the Internet of Things (IoT), user profile system, big data, and many other advanced information technologies. The framework of methods can provide a useful reference for the systematic technical scheme of smart geriatric nursing in an aging society. Copyright © 2020 Shijie Li and Yongchuan Tang.

AB  - Wearable sensor-based devices are increasingly applied in free-living and clinical settings to collect fine-grained, objective data about activity and sleep behavior. The manufacturers of these devices provide proprietary software that labels the sensor data at specified time intervals with activity and sleep information. If the device wearer has a health condition affecting their movement, such as a stroke, these labels and their values can vary greatly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Consequently, generating outcome predictions based on data collected from patients attending inpatient rehabilitation wearing different sensor devices can be challenging, which hampers usefulness of these data for patient care decisions. In this article, we present a data-driven approach to combining datasets collected from different device manufacturers. With the ability to combine datasets, we merge data from three different device manufacturers to form a larger dataset of time series data collected from 44 patients receiving inpatient therapy services. To gain insights into the recovery process, we use this dataset to build models that predict a patient's next day physical activity duration and next night sleep duration. Using our data-driven approach and the combined dataset, we obtained a normalized root mean square error prediction of 9.11% for daytime physical activity and 11.18% for nighttime sleep duration. Our sleep result is comparable to the accuracy we achieved using the manufacturer's sleep labels (12.26%). Our device-independent predictions are suitable for both point-of-care and remote monitoring applications to provide information to clinicians for customizing therapy services and potentially decreasing recovery time.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - High-performance flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity and large sensing range are vital components of the system for physiological signals collection, human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. Herein, a flexible pressure sensor of copper nanowires/reduced graphene oxide/melamine foam (CuRGOMF) was fabricated by coating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and in-situ growing of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) on the skeleton of melamine foam (MF). The as-prepared sensor features high sensitivity at wide working range (0.011 kPa−1, 0–1.5 kPa; 0.088 kPa−1, 1.5–10 kPa and 0.024kPa−1, 10–18 kPa) and cyclic stability (5000 cycles). The human motions of finger bending, grasping, clicking the mouse and picking up/dropping objects can be successfully detected in real-time based on the CuRGOMF sensor. The CuRGOMF sensor illustrates a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable device in artificial intelligence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF rehospitalization. Methods: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were formally adjudicated. Results: One hundred subjects aged 68.4±10.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge, the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of expected physiological values. Differences between baseline model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF events. The platform was able to detect precursors of hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88% sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. Conclusions: Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be further tested.  © 2020 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - In nearly 1 month, with a rapidly expanding corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), telemedicine has been transformed into an essential service for delivering routine clinical care. This transformation occurred as a crisis management response - driven by the need to provide care for patients with physical distancing measures in place. However, the current rapid adoption of telemedicine presents a transitional state between one that existed before the pandemic and one that could potentially be better aligned with the delivery of a personalized model of care. Using the conceptual framework of digital translucence - situating virtual encounters with more nuanced information regarding patients - we describe the role of integrated remote monitoring and virtual care tools aligned with the patient's electronic health record for adapting telemedicine delivery post-COVID-19.  © Copyright 2020, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2020.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Ever-evolving advances in flexible magnetic sensors are promising to fuel technological developments in the fields of touchless human-machine interaction, implantable medical diagnosis, and magnetoreception for artificial intelligence. However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation. This ultrasensitive flexible sensor provides a platform capable of sensing and responding to external magnetic fields and will find applications in soft robotics, wearable healthcare monitoring, and consumer electronics.  © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.

AB  - Estimation of muscle excitations from a reduced sensor array could greatly improve current techniques in remote patient monitoring. Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences. © 2013 IEEE.
