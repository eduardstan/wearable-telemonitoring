  abstract={Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.},

  abstract={The revolution of IoT highly impacts on different applications such as remote sensing, smart cities, and remote digital healthcare. People use IoT devices for performing business transactions, daily tasks, and healthcare monitoring. IoT devices generate huge amounts of data assets that have potential applications. Biometrics is a potential application of sensors data. The traditional biometric methods such as PINs, passwords are exposed to numerous attacks such as replication, repeated passwords, etc. Sensors’ data-based continuous authentication methods are suitable for maintaining users’ privacy and security in mobile IoT systems. Most of the existing authentication methods have applied motion-based sensors for building users’ identification profiles. The proposed method uses motion sensors and biomedical sensors for reliable and multi-factor user authentication. In this article, we have introduced an IoT sensors data analytics framework to construct user authentication models. We apply the fiducial points-based feature extraction method data for extracting discriminative features. These features act as unique user profiles for authentication purposes. We have performed a detailed analysis of the proposed approach using the publically available datasets. The experiments elaborate on the effectiveness of IoTauth for improved authentication results.},

  pages={27256-27264},
  abstract={Advanced sensing technologies such as remote sensing and sensor networks, important for enhancing land use through soil condition monitoring, are facing issues including high machine learning costs, limited measurement point density, and environmental impact. This study introduces a remote sensing method that offers both direct and wide-area sensing of soil properties using a dispersible, biodegradable cuboid-shaped isotropic metamaterial equipped with a water-soluble Mg-based resonance antenna structure. The symmetrical metal patterns ensure isotropic reflectance within the 1.2–3.6-GHz range, enabling robust sensing even when the metamaterial is dispersed randomly on the soil. The degradation of the Mg antenna in the soil presents a significant reflection reduction from 80% to 20% at a 2.4-GHz resonant frequency on the soil, promoting the feasibility of combination with a simple wireless measurement system. Integration with functional coatings that dissolve in response to specific soil substances such as pH-sensitive hydroxyapatite leads to the development of biodegradable soil remote monitoring sensors, offering precise, sustainable land management.},

  abstract={In the case of diabetes, fingertip pricking for blood sample is inconvenient for glucose measurement. Invasive approaches like laboratory tests and one touch glucometers enhance the risk of blood related infections. To mitigate this important issue, this article introduces a novel Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) enabled edge-device for precise, noninvasive blood glucose measurement. The device called “Intelligent Glucose Meter” (i.e., iGLU) is based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and a machine learning model of high accuracy. iGLU has been validated in a hospital and blood glucose values are stored in an IoMT platform for remote monitoring by endocrinologists.},

  year={2020},
  volume={16},
  number={11},
  pages={7150-7158},
  abstract={Long-term blood pressure (BP) monitoring is a widely used approach in a homecare intelligent system. However, BP is usually measured using cuff-based devices with tedious operation in practice, which may not be cost effective for continuous BP tracking. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based multitask network with a weighting scheme for BP estimation by analyzing and modeling single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method could achieve mean error of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and mean arterial pressure estimation in levels of 0.18 ± 10.83, 1.24 ± 5.90, and 0.84 ± 6.47 mmHg, respectively. In comparison to other cutting-edge methods using ECG signals, the proposed method shows superior BP estimation performance. By integrating with a wearable/portable ECG monitoring device, the proposed model can be deployed to an embedded system or remote healthcare intelligent system to provide long-term BP monitoring service, which would help to reduce the incidence of malignant events happened in hypertensive population.},

  abstract={Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume & performance, device diversity & interoperability, hacking & unauthorized use and acceptance & adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics.},

  abstract={Following the standardization and deployment of the 5G network, researchers have shifted their focus to beyond 5G (B5G) communication. Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication. These intelligent walls, equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and computation power, would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation health care in the era of B5G.},

Due to to the advancements in Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), wearable devices, remote monitoring of patients is possible like never before. Machine learning and deep learning techniques help the doctors immensely in remotely diagnosing the patients by learning the patterns from the data generated through these devices [1]. The main problem with traditional machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models is that the data from the individual devices, sensors, wearables of patients have to be transferred to the central servers to train the data using the ML/DL models. Due to the sensitive nature of the healthcare data, the aforementioned approach of transferring the patients’ data to the central servers may create serious security and privacy issues.},
