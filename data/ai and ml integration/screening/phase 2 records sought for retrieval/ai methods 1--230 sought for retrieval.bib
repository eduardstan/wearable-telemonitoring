   abstract = {Continuous and reliable monitoring of gait is crucial for health monitoring, such as postoperative recovery of bone joint surgery and early diagnosis of disease. However, existing gait analysis systems often suffer from large volumes and the requirement of special space for setting motion capture systems, limiting their application in daily life. Here, we develop an intelligent gait monitoring and analysis prediction system based on flexible piezoelectric sensors and deep learning neural networks with high sensitivity (241.29 mV/N), quick response (66 ms loading, 87 ms recovery), and excellent stability (R2 = 0.9946). The theoretical simulations and experiments confirm that the sensor provides exceptional signal feedback, which can easily acquire accurate gait data when fitted to shoe soles. By integrating high-quality gait data with a custom-built deep learning model, the system can detect and infer human motion states in real time (the recognition accuracy reaches 94.7%). To further validate the sensor’s application in real life, we constructed a flexible wearable recognition system with human-computer interaction interface and a simple operation process for long-term and continuous tracking of athletes’ gait, potentially aiding personalized health management, early detection of disease, and remote medical care. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

Such a feature enabled the bending sensor to simultaneously have a wide dynamic range of bending strain (0.025-5.4%), high gauge factor (∼74), and high linearity (R2∼0.99). Furthermore, the bending sensor can capture repeated instantaneous changes in strain and various types of vibrations, owing to its fast response time. Moreover, the bending direction can be differentiated with a single layer of the sensor, and using an array of sensors integrated on a glove, object recognition was demonstrated via machine learning. Finally, a self-monitoring proprioceptive ionic electroactive polymer (IEAP) actuator capable of operating in liquid was demonstrated.

MXene is regarded as one of the most ideal candidate sensing materials due to its high electrical conductivity and controllable interlayer space. However, the easy-to-oxidize characteristic of MXene materials greatly restricts the sensitivity and reliability of sensor devices, especially in wet climates. Herein, a highly sensitive and waterproof flexible pressure sensor using a free-standing hydrophobic bacterial cellulose/Ti3C2Tx MXene (HBT) hybrid film as a sensing layer is fabricated by facile and effective nanocellulose intercalation and fluorine modification strategies. The obtained pressure sensor delivers high sensitivity (65.5 kPa-1), fast response (50 ms), wide linear sensing range (0.002-30 kPa) with a low detection limit of 0.57 Pa, and excellent repeatability over 50,000 cycles. Meanwhile, owing to the highly hydrophobic surface of the HTB film, the outstanding sensing features could be well retained, although immersed in water several times. Benefiting from the excellent sensing properties and water resistance, the HBT sensor serves as a wearable force sensor to monitor the full-range human physiological motions regardless of whether the conditions are normal or wet. This work provides a new pathway to design the MXene pressure sensor with high reliability and demonstrates the promising usage of HBT sensors in portable biomedical electronics. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Current wearable sensors are fabricated with substrates, which limits the comfort, flexibility, stretchability, and induces interface mismatch. In addition, the substrate prevents the evaporation of sweat and is harmful to skin health. In this work, we have enabled the substrate-free laser scribed graphene (SFG) electronic skin (e-skin) with multifunctions. Compared with the e-skin with the substrate, the SFG has good gas permeability, low impedance, and flexibility. Only assisted using water, the SFG can be transferred to almost any objects including silicon and human skin and it can even be suspended. Many through-holes like stomas in leaf can be formed in the SFG, which make it breathable. After designing the pattern, the gauge factor (GF) of graphene electronic skin (GES) can be designed as the strain sensor. Physiological signals such as respiration, human motion, and electrocardiogram (ECG) can be detected. Moreover, the suspended SFG detect vibrations with high sensitivity. Due to the substrate-free structure, the impedance between SFG e-skin and the human body decreases greatly. Finally, an ECG detecting system has been designed based on the GES, which can monitor the body condition in real time. To analyze the ECG signals automatically, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was built and trained successfully.

Theoretical principles, including the enhancement of the β-phase and the lower surface potential of the modified nanomesh, were quantitatively investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, band theory, and Kelvin probe force microscopy. Furthermore, we endowed the IWFS with a healthcare monitoring function and man-machine interactive capability through machine learning and wireless transmission technology. Crucial physiological signals of people, including breath, cough, and speaking signals, were detected and classified, with a high recognition rate of 92%; the fabricated IWFS can collect healthcare data and transmit voice commands in real time without hindrance by portable electronic devices.

The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 »000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.  ©},

   abstract = {Recently, wearable and flexible pressure sensors have sparked tremendous research interest, and considerable applications including human activity monitoring, biomedical research, and artificial intelligence interaction are reported. However, the large-scale preparation of low-cost, high-sensitivity piezoresistive sensors still face huge challenges. Inspired by the specific structures and excellent metal conductivity of a family of two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) and the high-performance sensing effect of human skin including randomly distributed microstructural receptors, we fabricate a highly sensitive MXene-based piezoresistive sensor with bioinspired microspinous microstructures formed by a simple abrasive paper stencil printing process. The obtained piezoresistive sensor shows high sensitivity (151.4 kPa-1), relatively short response time (<130 ms), subtle pressure detection limit of 4.4 Pa, and excellent cycle stability over 10,000 cycles. The mechanism of the high sensitivity of the sensor is dynamically revealed from the structural perspective by means of in situ electron microscopy experiment and finite element simulation. Bioinspired microspinous microstructures can effectively improve the sensitivity of the pressure sensor and the limit of the detectable subtle pressure. In practice, the sensor shows great performance in monitoring human physiological signals, detecting quantitatively pressure distributions, and remote monitoring of intelligent robot motion in real time. © 2020 American Chemical Society.},

Here, a functional material that integrates mechanoluminescent units with biosensing units through supramolecular interactions, enabling bimodal non-interfering visual detection of orthodontic force and bacterial infection is presented. The orthodontic force induces fluorescence by facilitating the release of electrons from trapped energy levels, caused by the disruption or rearrangement of defect structures within strontium aluminate crystals. Meanwhile, the seamlessly integrated biosensing component can effectively detect lactic acid in a dose-dependent manner, underscoring its multifunctional capabilities in biosensing applications. Moreover, the development of a cloud-based deep learning server can achieve a 97.7% accuracy in the precise decoupling of visual signals, facilitating remote monitoring and enabling early intervention during orthodontic treatment.

Medical infrastructure, which for decades sought to reduce the incidence and severity of communicable diseases, has proven insufficient in meeting the intensive, long-term monitoring needs of many NCD disease patient groups. In addition, existing portable devices with rigid electronics are still limited in clinical use due to unreliable data, limited functionality, and lack of continuous measurement ability. Here, a wearable system for at-home cardiovascular monitoring of postpartum women—a group with urgently unmet NCD needs in the United States—using a cloud-integrated soft sternal device with conformal nanomembrane sensors is introduced. A supporting mobile application provides device data to a custom cloud architecture for real-time waveform analytics, including medical device-grade blood pressure prediction via deep learning, and shares the results with both patient and clinician to complete a robust and highly scalable remote monitoring ecosystem. Validated in a month-long clinical study with 20 postpartum Black women, the system demonstrates its ability to remotely monitor existing disease progression, stratify patient risk, and augment clinical decision-making by informing interventions for groups whose healthcare needs otherwise remain unmet in standard clinical practice. © 2024 The Authors.

   abstract = {Objective: To explore the effectiveness of cardiac remote monitoring system (CRMS) based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode for evaluating asymptomatic myocardial ischemia (AMI) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Two hundred CAD patients confirmed by coronary angiography (CA) in our hospital were included as the study subjects, 120 of whom developed myocardial ischemia (MI). All patients received 12-lead telephone remote ECG monitoring and evaluation. After monitoring, artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm was performed to observe the detection rate of MI. Results: Compared with artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm combined with remote ECG monitoring system, the detection rate of remote ECG monitoring system in 120 MI patients was lower (96.67% vs. 86.67%, P<0.01). Among the 120 MI patients, there were 26 patients (21.67%) with symptomatic myocardial ischemia (SMI) and 94 patients (78.33%) with AMI. There was no difference between the two detection methods in the diagnosis of SMI (P>0.05), while there was a difference in the diagnosis of AMI (P<0.01). The degree and duration of ST segment decline and the threshold variability of MI were higher in SMI patients than those in AMI patients (P<0.001). It showed that the lowest frequency of MI was from 0:00 to 06:00, and the highest from 06:01 to 12:00, with significant difference compared with other time periods (P<0.05). Conclusion: The CRMS based on artificial intelligence-enabled ECG algorithm mode can significantly improve the detection rate of AMI. Moreover, small changes of ST segment in AMI patients and circadian rhythm of disease onset were presented.},

This Perspective addresses the advancement of these wearable sensors that encounter multiple challenges on the forefront and technological gaps hampering the realization of health monitoring at molecular levels related to smart materials mostly limited to single use, issues of selectivity to analytes, low sensitivity to targets, miniaturization, and lack of artificial intelligence to perform multiple tasks and secure big data transfer. Sensor stability with minimized signal drift, on-body sensor reusability, and long-term continuous health monitoring provides key analytical challenges. This Perspective also focuses on, promotes, and highlights wearable sensors with a distinct capability to interconnect with telemedicine healthcare for physical sensing and multiplex sensing at deeper levels. Moreover, it points out some critical challenges in different material aspects and promotes what it will take to advance the current state-of-art wearable sensors for telemedicine healthcare. Ultimately, this Perspective is to draw attention to some potential blind spots of wearable technology development and to inspire further development of this integrated technology in mitigating multimorbidity in aging societies through health monitoring at molecular levels to identify signs of diseases. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Remote monitoring and artificial intelligence will become common and intertwined in anesthesiology by 2050. In the intraoperative period, technology will lead to the development of integrated monitoring systems that will integrate multiple data streams and allow anesthesiologists to track patients more effectively. This will free up anesthesiologists to focus on more complex tasks, such as managing risk and making value-based decisions. This will also enable the continued integration of remote monitoring and control towers having profound effects on coverage and practice models. In the PACU and ICU, the technology will lead to the development of early warning systems that can identify patients who are at risk of complications, enabling early interventions and more proactive care. The integration of augmented reality will allow for better integration of diverse types of data and better decision-making. Postoperatively, the proliferation of wearable devices that can monitor patient vital signs and track their progress will allow patients to be discharged from the hospital sooner and receive care at home. This will require increased use of telemedicine, which will allow patients to consult with doctors remotely. All of these advances will require changes to legal and regulatory frameworks that will enable new workflows that are different from those familiar to today's providers. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation.

Several vital signals, such as voice signals, can be acquired anytime and anywhere, achieved with the least possible discomfort to the patient thanks to the development of increasingly advanced devices. The integration of sensors with artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the realization of faster and easier solutions aimed at improving early diagnosis, personalized treatment, remote patient monitoring and better decision making, all tasks vital in a critical situation such as that of the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents a study about the possibility to support the early and non-invasive detection of COVID-19 through the analysis of voice signals by means of the main machine learning algorithms. If demonstrated, this detection capacity could be embedded in a powerful mobile screening application. To perform this important study, the Coswara dataset is considered. The aim of this investigation is not only to evaluate which machine learning technique best distinguishes a healthy voice from a pathological one, but also to identify which vowel sound is most seriously affected by COVID-19 and is, therefore, most reliable in detecting the pathology. The results show that Random Forest is the technique that classifies most accurately healthy and pathological voices.

To reduce the outbreak impact of COVID-19 virus illness, continual identification and remote surveillance of patients are essential. Medical service delivery based on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology backed up by the fog-cloud paradigm is an efficient and time-sensitive solution for remote patient surveillance. Conspicuously, a comprehensive framework based on Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) and body-wearable sensor technologies supported by the fog-cloud platform is proposed for the identification and management of COVID-19 patients. The J48 decision tree is used to assess the infection degree of the user based on corresponding symptoms. RFID is used to detect Temporal Proximity Interactions (TPI) among users. Using TPI quantification, Temporal Network Analysis is used to analyze and track the current stage of the COVID-19 spread. The statistical performance and accuracy of the framework are assessed by utilizing synthetically-generated data for 250,000 users. Based on the comparative analysis, the proposed framework acquired an enhanced measure of classification accuracy, and sensitivity of 96.68% and 94.65% respectively.

This goal might be achieved by combining sophisticated expert systems with extensive healthcare data on heart diseases. Several machine learning-based methods have recently been proven for predicting and diagnosing cardiac illness. However, these algorithms are unable to manage high-dimensional information due to the lack of a smart framework that can combine several sources to anticipate cardiac illness. The Fuzzy-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model is used in this work to present a unique IoT-enabled heart disease prediction method. The benchmark data for the experiment came from public sources and collected via wearable IoT devices. An improved Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) called Population and Fitness-based HHO (PF-HHO) is utilized to select the best features, with the objective function of correlation maximization within the same class and correlation minimization among different classes. The scientific contributions of the health care monitoring system are depicted here that help to improve heart disease healthcare efficiency and also it can be reducing the death rate in the current world. The important section of this persistent healthcare mode is the real-world monitoring system.

The wearable sensors are responsible for sensing the psychological vitals of humans at different intervals to detect their precise health status. This article introduces an Interfering Input Classification Model (IICM) for addressing the continuous and discrete data extraction issues in RPM. The proposed model hybridizes whale optimization and deep-Q-learning for classification and connectivity identification between different interval data. The sensed information is segregated as discrete and continuous using the search process termination of the whales. Such classified data is validated for the maximum discreteness and its interconnection between the previous sequences. This interconnection is performed using Q-learning based on different state changes through continuous clinical range correlations. The proposed model exemplifies continuous and discrete signals (data) for abnormality detection and diagnosis recommendation. Thus the proposed model is reliable in improving the classification ratio and accuracy with fewer errors. The experimental values of the proposed model are as follows: IICM enhances classification by 6.65%, signal identification by 6.63%, and classification accuracy by 10.08%. This model reduces classification time by 9.51% and error by 10.14% for different ranges of inputs. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

Innovations made using technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, cloud computing and artificial intelligence are helping address this crisis. The urge for remote monitoring, symptom analysis and early detection of diseases lead to tremendous increase in the deployment of wearable sensor devices. They facilitate seamless gathering of physiological data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, respiration traces (RESP), galvanic skin response (GSR), pulse rate, body temperature, photoplethysmograms (PPG), oxygen saturation (SpO2) etc. For diagnosis and analysis purpose, the gathered data needs to be stored. Wearable devices operate on batteries and have a memory constraint. In mHealth application architectures, this gathered data is hence stored on cloud based servers. While transmitting data from wearable devices to cloud servers via edge devices, a lot of energy is consumed. This paper proposes a deep learning based compression model SCAElite that reduces the data volume, enabling energy efficient transmission. Results: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers dataset and MIT-BIH dataset from PhysioNet are used for validation of algorithm performance. The model achieves a compression ratio of up to 300 fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the stress recognition dataset and 106.34-fold with reconstruction errors within 8% over the MIT-BIH dataset. The computational complexity of SCAElite is 51.65% less compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. Conclusion: It is experimentally validated that SCAElite guarantees a high compression ratio with good quality restoration capabilities for physiological signal compression in mHealth applications. It has a compact architecture and is computationally more efficient compared to state-of-the-art deep compressive model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a neuro-degenerative disorder characterized by the progressive death of dopamine neurons. This leads to delayed and uncoordinated movements, and impacts on the patients’ motor performance with reduced movement intensity, increased axial rigidity and impaired cadence regulation. Turning provides privileged insights in postural instability and fall prediction, as it is regularly performed during daily activities, requires multi-limb coordination. The objective of this work was to define a Quality of Movement (QoM) index, inferred from inertial data related to turns, and strictly correlated with the patient's motor conditions, postural stability, and stage of the disease. Such a concise representation finds its main application in the remote monitoring of patients during daily activities at home. We have recorded and analyzed 180° turns in 72 patients, using inertial sensors embedded in the smartphone. We have set up an algorithm for binary classification of patients: mild vs. moderate/severe conditions, according to the Hoehn and Yahr scale of disease progression and disability degree. Our QoM index is defined as the a posteriori probability output by this binary classifier. It exhibits high correlation (r = 0.73) with the clinical score of postural stability, as well as with the average of four clinical scores related to movement impairment (r = 0.75). These results, together with the widespread smartphone use, provide a step in the direction of a practical, objective and reliable tool for PD patients remote monitoring in domestic environment. © 2020 The Authors},

Sweat, one of the most suitable biological fluids for non-invasive monitoring, contains various chemical elements relating abundant information about human health conditions. In this work, a new type of non-invasive and highly stretchable potentiometric sweat sensor was developed based on all-solid-state ion-selective electrode (ISE) coupled with poly(dimethylsiloxane; PDMS) and polyurethane (PU). This highly stretchable composite of PDMS-PU allows the sensor to be robust, with the PDMS providing a flexible backbone and the PU enhancing the adhesion between the electrodes and the substrate. In addition, graphene–carbon nanotube (CNT) network 3D nanomaterials were introduced to modify the ion selective membrane (ISM) in order to increase the charge transfer activity of the ISEs, which also could minimize the formation of water layers on the electrode surface, as such nanomaterials are highly hydrophobic. As a result, the sensor demonstrated a wide detection range of NH4+ from 10−6 M to 10−1 M with high stability and sensitivity—showing a high sensitivity of 59.6 ± 1.5 mV/log [NH4+] and an LOD lower than 10−6 M. Under a strain of 40%, the sensor still showed a sensitivity of 42.7 ± 3.1 mV/log [NH4+]. The proposed highly stretchable and robust electrochemical sweat sensor provides a new choice for wearable-device-based personal daily healthcare management beyond hospital-centric healthcare monitoring.},

Current diagnosis relies on subjective lung auscultation by physicians. Enabling this capability via a low-profile, objective wearable device for remote patient monitoring (RPM) could offer pre-emptive, accurate respiratory data to patients. With this goal as our aim, we used a low-profile accelerometer-based wearable system that utilizes deep learning to objectively detect wheezing along with respiration rate using a single sensor. The miniature patch consists of a sensitive wideband MEMS accelerometer and low-noise CMOS interface electronics on a small board, which was then placed on nine conventional lung auscultation sites on the patient’s chest walls to capture the pulmonary-induced vibrations (PIVs). A deep learning model was developed and compared with a deterministic time–frequency method to objectively detect wheezing in the PIV signals using data captured from 52 diverse patients with respiratory diseases. The wearable accelerometer patch, paired with the deep learning model, demonstrated high fidelity in capturing and detecting respiratory wheezes and patterns across diverse and pertinent settings. It achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95%, 96%, and 93%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.99 on the test set—outperforming the deterministic time–frequency approach. Furthermore, the accelerometer patch outperforms the digital stethoscopes in sound analysis while offering immunity to ambient sounds, which not only enhances data quality and performance for computational wheeze detection by a significant margin but also provides a robust sensor solution that can quantify respiration patterns simultaneously. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Skin-inspired flexible wearable acceleration sensors attract much attention due to their advantages of portability, personalized and comfortable experience, and potential application in healthcare monitoring, human–machine interfaces, artificial intelligence, and physical sports performance evaluation. This paper presents a flexible wearable acceleration sensor for monitoring human motion by introducing the island–bridge configuration and serpentine interconnects. Compared with traditional wearable accelerometers, the flexible accelerometer proposed in this paper improves the wearing comfort while reducing the cost of the device. Simulation and experiments under bending, stretching, and torsion conditions demonstrate that the flexible performance of the flexible acceleration sensor can meet the needs of monitoring the daily movement of the human body, and it can work normally under various conditions. The measurement accuracy of the flexible acceleration sensor is verified by comparing it with the data of the commercial acceleration sensor. The flexible acceleration sensor can measure the acceleration and the angular velocity of the human body with six degrees of freedom and recognize the gesture and motion features according to the acceleration characteristics. The presented flexible accelerometers provide great potential in recognizing the motion features that are critical for healthcare monitoring and physical sports performance evaluation. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background: The cost of heart failure hospitalizations in the US alone is over USD 10 billion per year. Over 4 million Americans are hospitalized every year due to heart failure (HF), with a median length of stay of 4 days and an in-hospital mortality rate that exceeds 5%. Hospitalizations of patients with HF can be prevented by early detection of lung congestion. Our study assessed a new contact-free optical medical device used for the early detection of lung congestion. Methods: The Gili system is an FDA-cleared device used for measuring chest motion vibration data. Lung congestion in the study was assessed clinically and verified via two cardiologists. An algorithm was developed using machine learning techniques, and cross-validation of the findings was performed to estimate the accuracy of the algorithm. Results: A total of 227 patients were recruited (101 cases vs. 126 controls). The sensitivity and specificity for the device in our study were 0.91 (95% CI: 0.86–0.93) and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.87–0.94), respectively. In all instances, the observed estimates of PPVs and NPVs were at least 0.82 and 0.90, respectively. The accuracy of the algorithm was not affected by different covariates (including respiratory or valvular conditions). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of a contact-free optical device for detecting lung congestion. Further validation of the study results across a larger and precise scale is warranted. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background: Continuous assessment and remote monitoring of cognitive function in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enables tracking therapeutic effects and modifying treatment to achieve better clinical outcomes. While standardized neuropsychological tests are inconvenient for this purpose, wearable sensor technology collecting physiological and behavioral data looks promising to provide proxy measures of cognitive function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of digital physiological features, based on sensor data from wrist-worn wearables, in determining neuropsychological test scores in individuals with MCI. Methods: We used the dataset collected from a 10-week single-arm clinical trial in older adults (50–70 years old) diagnosed with amnestic MCI (N = 30) who received a digitally delivered multidomain therapeutic intervention. Cognitive performance was assessed before and after the intervention using the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) from which composite scores were calculated (executive function, processing speed, immediate memory, delayed memory and global cognition). The Empatica E4, a wrist-wearable medical-grade device, was used to collect physiological data including blood volume pulse, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. We processed sensors’ data and extracted a range of physiological features. We used interpolated NTB scores for 10-day intervals to test predictability of scores over short periods and to leverage the maximum of wearable data available. In addition, we used individually centered data which represents deviations from personal baselines. Supervised machine learning was used to train models predicting NTB scores from digital physiological features and demographics. Performance was evaluated using “leave-one-subject-out” and “leave-one-interval-out” cross-validation. Results: The final sample included 96 aggregated data intervals from 17 individuals. In total, 106 digital physiological features were extracted. We found that physiological features, especially measures of heart rate variability, correlated most strongly to the executive function compared to other cognitive composites. The model predicted the actual executive function scores with correlation r = 0.69 and intra-individual changes in executive function scores with r = 0.61. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that wearable-based physiological measures, primarily HRV, have potential to be used for the continuous assessments of cognitive function in individuals with MCI. © 2024, The Author(s).},

   abstract = {Background: Breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) is primarily managed at home and can stem from physical exertion and emotional distress triggers. Beyond these triggers, the impact of ambient environment on pain occurrence and intensity has not been investigated. This study explores the impact of environmental factors on the frequency and severity of breakthrough cancer pain (BTCP) in the home context from the perspective of patients with advanced cancer and their primary family caregiver. Methods: A health monitoring system was deployed in the homes of patient and family caregiver dyads to collect self-reported pain events and contextual environmental data (light, temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, ambient noise.) Correlation analysis examined the relationship between environmental factors with: 1) individually reported pain episodes and 2) overall pain trends in a 24-hour time window. Machine learning models were developed to explore how environmental factors may predict BTCP episodes. Results: Variability in correlation strength between environmental variables and pain reports among dyads was found. Light and noise show moderate association (r = 0.50–0.70) in 66% of total deployments. The strongest correlation for individual pain events involved barometric pressure (r = 0.90); for pain trends over 24-hours the strongest correlations involved humidity (r = 0.84) and barometric pressure (r = 0.83). Machine learning achieved 70% BTCP prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Our study provides insights into the role of ambient environmental factors in BTCP and offers novel opportunities to inform personalized pain management strategies, remotely support patients and their caregivers in self-symptom management. This research provides preliminary evidence of the impact of ambient environmental factors on BTCP in the home setting. We utilized real-world data and correlation analysis to provide an understanding of the relationship between environmental factors and cancer pain which may be helpful to others engaged in similar work.},

   abstract = {Background: Depression is a common condition among cancer patients, across several points in the disease trajectory. Although presenting higher prevalence rates than the general population, it is often not reported or remains unnoticed. Moreover, somatic symptoms of depression are common in the oncological context and should not be dismissed as a general symptom of cancer. It becomes even more challenging to track psychological distress in the period after the treatment, where connection with the healthcare system typically becomes sporadic. The main goal of the FAITH project is to remotely identify and predict depressive symptoms in cancer survivors, based on a federated machine learning (ML) approach, towards optimization of privacy. Methods: FAITH will remotely analyse depression markers, predicting their negative trends. These markers will be treated in distinct categories, namely nutrition, sleep, activity and voice, assessed in part through wearable technologies. The study will include 300 patients who have had a previous diagnosis of breast or lung cancer and will be recruited 1 to 5 years after the end of primary cancer. The study will be organized as a 12-month longitudinal prospective observational cohort study, with monthly assessments to evaluate depression symptoms and quality of life among cancer survivors. The primary endpoint is the severity of depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (Ham-D) at months 3, 6, 9 and 12. Secondary outcomes include self-reported anxiety and depression symptoms (HADS scale), and perceived quality of life (EORTC questionnaires), at baseline and monthly. Based on the predictive models gathered during the study, FAITH will also aim at further developing a conceptual federated learning framework, enabling to build machine learning models for the prediction and monitoring of depression without direct access to user’s personal data. Discussion: Improvements in the objectivity of psychiatric assessment are necessary. Wearable technologies can provide potential indicators of depression and anxiety and be used for biofeedback. If the FAITH application is effective, it will provide healthcare systems with a novel and innovative method to screen depressive symptoms in oncological settings.

   abstract = {Introduction Diabetes prevalence continues to grow and there remains a significant diagnostic gap in one-third of the US population that has pre-diabetes. Innovative, practical strategies to improve monitoring of glycemic health are desperately needed. In this proof-of-concept study, we explore the relationship between non-invasive wearables and glycemic metrics and demonstrate the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glycemic metrics, including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and glucose variability metrics. Research design and methods We recorded over 25 000 measurements from a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) with simultaneous wrist-worn wearable (skin temperature, electrodermal activity, heart rate, and accelerometry sensors) data over 8-10 days in 16 participants with normal glycemic state and pre-diabetes (HbA1c 5.2-6.4). We used data from the wearable to develop machine learning models to predict HbA1c recorded on day 0 and glucose variability calculated from the CGM. We tested the accuracy of the HbA1c model on a retrospective, external validation cohort of 10 additional participants and compared results against CGM-based HbA1c estimation models. Results A total of 250 days of data from 26 participants were collected. Out of the 27 models of glucose variability metrics that we developed using non-invasive wearables, 11 of the models achieved high accuracy (<10% mean average per cent error, MAPE). Our HbA1c estimation model using non-invasive wearables data achieved MAPE of 5.1% on an external validation cohort. The ranking of wearable sensor's importance in estimating HbA1c was skin temperature (33%), electrodermal activity (28%), accelerometry (25%), and heart rate (14%). Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility of using non-invasive wearables to estimate glucose variability metrics and HbA1c for glycemic monitoring and investigates the relationship between non-invasive wearables and the glycemic metrics of glucose variability and HbA1c. The methods used in this study can be used to inform future studies confirming the results of this proof-of-concept study.  ©},

However, there remain considerable challenges for AFFs to fulfill specific requirements of advanced applications due to their low electrical outputs, limitation in materials selection, and difficulty in regulating microstructures on narrow and curved surface of the fibers. In this study, fabricating and regulating honeycomb porous microstructures (HPMs) on one-dimensional nonplanar fiber surfaces were proposed and systematically studied for developing AFFs with customized functionalities. As a demonstration of application, multifunctional silver-plated nylon fibers surface-engineered with HPMs (SNF@HPMs) were developed with the assistance of the BF method and were further fabricated into SNF@HPMs-based triboelectric nanogenerator (SNF@HPMs-TENG).

Moreover, a self-powered wearable sensor based on SNF@HPMs was also developed for monitoring the bending, tactile, and frictional stimuli in a real-time manner.

Herein, superhydrophobic and multi-responsive fabric composites with outstanding electro-photo-thermal effect and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding (EMI) performance are fabricated by decoration of conductive Ag nanoparticles onto the oxygen plasma treated polypropylene (PP) fabric, followed by multiple spray-coating with a mixture of Fe3O4 nanoparticles/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).

Moreover, the PDMS coating not only improves the interface adhesion between the nanoparticles and fibers, but also endows the fabric composites with superhydrophobicity, leading to an excellent self-cleaning performance. Surprisingly, the fabric composites also exhibit multiple responsive properties to electron and light, known as electro-photo-thermal effect, which can be maintained during mechanical deformations and cold environment.

However, achieving a combination of adequate skin adhesion, long-term stability and visible human-sensor interface are still challengeable. Here, a simple and effective strategy was proposed to fabricate “all-in-one” hydrolyzed keratin protein-modified polyacrylamide composite hydrogel transducer. Hydrolyzed keratin endowed hydrogel with lower modulus and ultra-stretchability to minimize wearing-related tension and discomfort. Specially, robust skin adhesion was obtained to achieve precise sensing without delamination. Impressively, the hydrogel had high transparency and exhibited wide-range temperature tolerance (−20 °C to 50 °C). Besides, the hydrogel with stable conductivity was extremely sensitive to pressure and strain at a wide range. As a result, the obtained transducer could not only detect human motion, respiratory mode and vocal-cord vibration, but also identify handwriting and facial expression.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Implantable cardiac sensors have shown promise in
reducing rehospitalization for heart failure (HF), but the
efficacy of noninvasive approaches has not been determined. The
objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of
noninvasive remote monitoring in predicting HF
rehospitalization. METHODS: The LINK-HF study (Multisensor
Non-invasive Remote Monitoring for Prediction of Heart Failure
Exacerbation) examined the performance of a personalized
analytical platform using continuous data streams to predict
rehospitalization after HF admission. Study subjects were
monitored for up to 3 months using a disposable multisensor
patch placed on the chest that recorded physiological data. Data
were uploaded continuously via smartphone to a cloud analytics
platform. Machine learning was used to design a prognostic
algorithm to detect HF exacerbation. Clinical events were
formally adjudicated. RESULTS: One hundred subjects aged
68.410.2 years (98% male) were enrolled. After discharge,
the analytical platform derived a personalized baseline model of
expected physiological values. Differences between baseline
model estimated vital signs and actual monitored values were
used to trigger a clinical alert. There were 35 unplanned
nontrauma hospitalization events, including 24 worsening HF
events. The platform was able to detect precursors of
hospitalization for HF exacerbation with 76% to 88%
sensitivity and 85% specificity. Median time between initial
alert and readmission was 6.5 (4.2-13.7) days. CONCLUSIONS:
Multivariate physiological telemetry from a wearable sensor can
provide accurate early detection of impending rehospitalization
with a predictive accuracy comparable to implanted devices. The
clinical efficacy and generalizability of this low-cost
noninvasive approach to rehospitalization mitigation should be
further tested. Registration: URL:

   abstract = {In recent years, healthcare monitoring systems (HMS) have increasingly integrated the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with cloud computing, leading to challenges related to data latency and efficient processing. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a Machine Learning-based Medical Data Segmentation (ML-MDS) approach that employs a k-fold random forest technique for efficient health data classification and latency reduction in a fog-cloud environment. Our method significantly improves latency issues, enhancing the Quality of Service (QoS) in healthcare systems and demonstrating its adaptability in heterogeneous network scenarios. We specifically employ the Random Forest algorithm to mitigate the common problem of overfitting in machine learning models, ensuring broader applicability across various healthcare contexts. Additionally, by optimizing data processing in fog computing layers, we achieve a substantial reduction in overall latency between healthcare sensors and cloud servers. This improvement is evidenced through a comparative performance analysis with existing models. The proposed framework not only ensures secure and scalable management of IoMT health data but also incorporates a stochastic approach to mathematically formulate performance indicators for the HMS queuing model. This model effectively predicts system response times and assesses the computing resources required under varying workload conditions. Our simulation results show a classification accuracy of 92%, a 56% reduction in latency compared to existing models, and an overall enhancement in e-healthcare service quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability and adhesiveness for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, we proposed a multifunctional MXene/polyampholytes nanocomposite hydrogel. The main network of this hydrogel was formed by the one-step radical polymerization of cationic monomer and anionic monomer. The simultaneous strong and weak ionic bonds-based crosslinking inside this hydrogel endowed it outstanding stretchable, tough, self-healing, adhesive properties, while the introduction of MXene further guaranteed the excellent mechanical properties and conductivity of this hydrogel. Our further exploration of this MXene/polyampholytes in the application as wearable epidermal sensor strongly proved its durable accuracy and sensitivity for the detection of human motions. This epidermal sensor also could be assembled to the detector of the daily activity monitor of Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients, which could be utilized to aid the ADHD treatment by remindering the patients to pay attention to their actions.

   abstract = {In recent days, research in human activity recognition (HAR) has played a significant role in healthcare systems. The accurate activity classification results from the HAR enhance the performance of the healthcare system with broad applications. HAR results are useful in monitoring a person's health, and the system predicts abnormal activities based on user movements. The HAR system's abnormal activity predictions provide better healthcare monitoring and reduce users' health issues. The conventional HAR systems use wearable sensors, such as inertial measurement unit (IMU) and stretch sensors for activity recognition. These approaches show remarkable performances to the user's basic activities such as sitting, standing, and walking. However, when the user performs complex activities, such as running, jumping, and lying, the sensor-based HAR systems have a higher degree of misclassification results due to the reading errors from sensors. These sensor errors reduce the overall performance of the HAR system with the worst classification results. Similarly, radiofrequency or vision-based HAR systems are not free from classification errors when used in real time. In this paper, we address some of the existing challenges of HAR systems by proposing a human image threshing (HIT) machine-based HAR system that uses an image dataset from a smartphone camera for activity recognition. The HIT machine effectively uses a mask region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for human body detection, a facial image threshing machine (FIT) for image cropping and resizing, and a deep learning model for activity classification. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed HIT machine-based HAR system through extensive experiments and results. The proposed HIT machine achieved 98.53% accuracy when the ResNet architecture was used as its deep learning model.  © 2022 Alwin Poulose et al.},

The application of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in electronic health (E-health) can efficiently promote the development of sustainable and smart cities. The IoT sensors and intelligent algorithms enable the remote monitoring and analyzing of the healthcare data of patients, which reduces the medical and travel expenses in cities. Existing deep learning-based methods for healthcare sensor data classification have made great achievements. However, these methods take much time and storage space for model training and inference. They are difficult to be deployed in small devices to classify the physiological signal of patients in real time. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a micro time series classification model called the micro neural network (MicroNN). The proposed model is micro enough to be deployed on tiny edge devices. MicroNN can be applied to long-term physiological signal monitoring based on edge computing devices. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the classification accuracy and computation complexity of MicroNN. Experiment results show that MicroNN performs better than the state-of-the-art methods. The accuracies on the two datasets (MIT-BIH-AR and INCART) are 98.4% and 98.1%, respectively.

Miniaturized wearable sensors are auspicious tools for biomedicine and healthcare systems. In this paper, we present D-SORM, a sensor fusion-based digital solution intended to assist clinicians and improve their diagnosis by providing objective measurements and automatic recognition. The aim is to supply an interface for remote monitoring to the medical staff. Methods: D-SORM platform estimates the wearable device attitude based on its acquired data, and visualizes it in real-time using a graphical user interface (GUI). It also integrates two modules which serve two different medical applications. The first one is arm tele-rehabilitation, where sessions are done online. The practitioner gives the instructions while wearing the device, and the patient has to reproduce the gestures. A processing unit is dedicated to compute statistical features and calculate the success rate. The second one is human motion tracking for elderly care. A novel machine learning architecture is proposed, based on feature fusion, to predict the activities of daily living. Results: The rehabilitation mechanism was tested under supervised conditions, by performing a set of movements. D-SORM provides extra information and objective measurements, thus facilitates the diagnosis of clinicians. The human activity recognition is also validated using a public dataset. With D-SORM, an efficiency ranging from 97.7% to 99.65% is ensured under unsupervised conditions.

This is because the IoMT devices lack adequate safeguards against cyberattacks. To address this issue, this article presents a proposed framework for detecting anomalies and cyberattacks. The proposed integrated model employs the 1) K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification, while 2) utilizing long-short term memory (LSTM) for feature extraction, and 3) applying Principal component analysis (PCA) to modify and reduce the features. PCA subsequently enhances the important temporal characteristics identified by the LSTM network.

The study analyzes data extracted from multiple vital signs and other contextual information for diagnostic purposes. The daily data collection process encounters sampling constraints due to weekends, holidays, shift changes, staff turnover, and equipment breakdowns, resulting in numerous nulls, repeated readings, outliers, and meaningless values. The short time series generated also pose a challenge to analysis, preventing the extraction of seasonal information or consistent trends. Blind data collection results in most of the data coming from periods when residents are healthy, resulting in excessively imbalanced data. This study proposes a data cleaning process and then builds a mechanism that reproduces the basal activity of the residents to improve the classification of the disease. The results show that the proposed basal module-assisted machine learning techniques allow anticipating diagnostics 2, 3 or 4 days before doctors decide to start treatment with antibiotics, achieving a performance measured by the area-under-the-curve metric of 0.857. The contributions of this work are: (1) a new data cleaning process; (2) the analysis of contextual information to improve data quality; (3) the generation of a baseline measure for relative comparison; and (4) the use of either binary (disease/no disease) or multiclass classification, differentiating among types of infections and showing the advantages of multiclass versus binary classification.

Security and privacy are key concerns on the IoMT, owing to the huge scale and deployment of IoMT networks. Machine learning (ML) and blockchain (BC) technologies have significantly enhanced the capabilities and facilities of healthcare 5.0, spawning a new area known as “Smart Healthcare.” By identifying concerns early, a smart healthcare system can help avoid long-term damage. This will enhance the quality of life for patients while reducing their stress and healthcare costs. The IoMT enables a range of functionalities in the field of information technology, one of which is smart and interactive health care. However, combining medical data into a single storage location to train a powerful machine learning model raises concerns about privacy, ownership, and compliance with greater concentration. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the preceding difficulties by utilizing a centralized aggregate server to disseminate a global learning model. Simultaneously, the local participant keeps control of patient information, assuring data confidentiality and security. This article conducts a comprehensive analysis of the findings on blockchain technology entangled with federated learning in healthcare. 5.0.

   abstract = {Background: In the real world, medical practice is changing hand in hand with the development of new Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems and problems from different areas have been successfully solved using AI algorithms. Specifically, the use of AI techniques in setting up or building precision medicine is significant in terms of the accuracy of disease discovery and tailored treatment. Moreover, with the use of technology, clinical personnel can deliver a very much efficient healthcare service. Objective: This article reviews AI state-of-the-art in cardiovascular disease management, focusing on diagnostic and therapeutic improvements. Methods: To that end, we conducted a detailed PubMed search on AI application from distinct areas of cardiology: heart failure, arterial hypertension, atrial fibrillation, syncope and cardiovascular rehabilitation. Particularly, to assess the impact of these technologies in clinical decision-making, this research considers technical and medical aspects. Results: On one hand, some devices in heart failure, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rehabilitation represent an inexpensive, not invasive or not very invasive approach to long-term surveillance and management in these areas. On the other hand, the availability of large datasets (big data) is a useful tool to predict the development and outcome of many cardiovascular diseases. In summary, with this new guided therapy, the physician can supply prompt, individualised, and tailored treatment and the patients feel safe as they are continuously monitored, with a significant psychological effect. Conclusion: Soon, tailored patient care via telemonitoring can improve clinical practice because AI-based systems support cardiologists in daily medical activities, improving disease detection and treatment. However, the physician-patient relationship remains a pivotal step.},

   abstract = {Starting from the escalating global burden of mental health disorders, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the article examines the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize mental health care. With nearly one in five adults facing mental health issues and suicide ranking as a leading cause of death among the young, the strained mental health system seeks innovative solutions. The text discusses the rapid evolution of AI, particularly in image analysis for early physical health diagnoses, and its promising applications in mental health, including predictive analytics for various disorders. AI’s ability to analyze written language, speech characteristics, and physiological signals from wearables offers avenues for remote monitoring and early prognosis. Despite the need to address ethical considerations, particularly biases in data sets and concerns about potential patient detachment, the article advocates for AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for human involvement in mental health services. Overall, the article emphasizes the transformative potential of AI in enhancing diagnostics, monitoring, and treatment strategies for mental health disorders. © 2024 Mary Ann Liebert Inc..

   abstract = {Background: The most recent exacerbation of COPD (ECOPD) classification criteria relies in part on changes in respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2). Despite this paradigm shift, a thorough understanding of exacerbation patterns is still lacking, as is the identification of physiological exacerbation biomarkers. Methods: Using a convenience sampling approach, this prospective observational cohort study was conducted between February 2023 and January 2024. Continuous measurements of daytime/overnight respiratory (primary outcome), cardiovascular, autonomic, activity and sleep-related parameters were collected by a wearable biometric wristband and ring over 21 consecutive days in free-living outpatients experiencing and receiving treatment (≤3 days) for a current exacerbation from the home environment. The EXACT-PRO questionnaire served as the validated reference for daily symptom burden and to identify ‘recovered’ versus ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Unadjusted and adjusted (for age, sex, FEV1) linear mixed-effects models were fitted to estimate associations between each physiological parameter with daily EXACT-PRO score (points, pts), in all, ‘recovered’, and ‘persistent worsening’ participants. Results are presented as point estimates with 95% CIs. Findings: In 21 participants with COPD (43% female, mean age 66.8, BMI 27.7 kg/m2, FEV1 36.3% predicted; 85.7% with GOLD 3–4 disease), significant associations in unadjusted models with daily EXACT-PRO score included RR variability (−1.45 [−2.84, −0.073] pts/breath/min) but not RR, daily step count (−0.56 [−0.82, −0.31] pts/1000 steps), and sleep efficiency (−0.12 [−0.20, −0.037] pts/%asleep). In ‘recovered’ participants (n = 10), significant associations included nighttime HR, movement intensity and nightly SpO2. In ‘persistent worsening’ participants (n = 11), significant associations included HR variability, nightly RR variability, nightly SpO2, sleep efficiency, and skin temperature. Similar results were found in adjusted models. Interpretation: This study provides a prospective continuous characterisation of exacerbations of COPD using remotely collected, ambulatory/free-living data. The physiological patterns presented may contribute to the understanding of exacerbations and may enhance the development of effective remote monitoring solutions.

   abstract = {Essential tremor (ET) is a prevalent neurological disorder that necessitates using objective and non-invasive methods for assessing symptom severity. Traditional visual assessments are often limited by subjectivity, while other wearable sensors or visual markers may result in unnatural movements. This study presents a novel contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment that integrates refined whole-body pose estimation with Transformer-based tremor detection to quantify tremor severity at a fine-grained level. The proposed pose estimation method combines the Transformer with HRNet, effectively capturing spatial-temporal complementary information from multiple body parts and enabling highly accurate tremor detection. The Transformer-based tremor detection is well-suited for modeling long-range dependencies and sequential tremor data extracted by the pose estimation model, further improving the performance of our proposed method. Our study collected data from 61 patients with ET, achieving an average accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 95.6%/95.6%, 89.2%/95.0%, and 83.0%/92.4% for classifying ET severity both during rest and postural tasks, respectively. Our proposed method outperforms the temporal convolutional network baseline, increasing F1 scores by 21.17% and 14.22% for rest and postural tasks, respectively. This high level of accuracy makes our method highly useful for clinical applications such as remote monitoring, diagnosis, and treatment evaluation. Our proposed technique has many advantages over traditional ET assessment techniques, including non-invasiveness, contact-free operation, and not requiring any wearable sensors or visual markers. Moreover, our method can be applied to other movement disorders requiring objective measurements of symptom severity. In summary, our contact-free visual-based pipeline for ET assessment represents a significant improvement over traditional ET assessment techniques, and our quantification results demonstrate its potential for use in clinical settings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Introduction: The advent of digital and mobile health innovations, especially use of wearables for passive data collection, allows remote monitoring and creates an abundance of data. For this information to be interpretable, machine learning (ML) processes are necessary. Research question: Can a machine learning model successfully identify patients expected to have low gait speed in the early recovery period following joint replacement surgery? Methods: A commercial database from a smartphone-based care management platform passively collecting mobility data pre- and post-lower limb arthroplasty was used. We sought to create a ML model to predict gait speed recovery curves and identify patients at risk of poor gait speed outcome, a measure associated with range of motion and patient-reported outcomes. Model performance including sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy were determined. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to compare true and false positive rates. To benchmark our model, we compared threshold-based notifications based on the patient's current gait speed. Results: The performance of the predictive model was significantly improved compared to baseline of threshold-based exceptions using current gait speed. The ML model currently provides 53 % precision, 88 % accuracy, 36 % sensitivity, and 95 % specificity on the held-out test set. The ROC analysis suggests good clinical performance (AUC=0.81). Significance: Utilization of ML to predict gait recovery following total joint replacement is feasible and provides results with excellent specificity. This model will allow inclusion of additional data for retraining as patient populations evolve. Clinician feedback regarding notifications, including resulting actions and outcomes, can be used to further inform the model and improve clinical utility. © 2024 The Authors},

   abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial growth in the prevalence and capabilities of wearable devices. For instance, recent human activity recognition (HAR) research has explored using wearable devices in applications such as remote monitoring of patients, detection of gait abnormalities, and cognitive disease identification. However, data collection poses a major challenge in developing HAR systems, especially because of the need to store data at a central location. This raises privacy concerns and makes continuous data collection difficult and expensive due to the high cost of transferring data from a user's wearable device to a central repository. Considering this, we explore the adoption of federated learning (FL) as a potential solution to address the privacy and cost issues associated with data collection in HAR. More specifically, we investigate the performance and behavioral differences between FL and deep learning (DL) HAR models, under various conditions relevant to real-world deployments. Namely, we explore the differences between the two types of models when (i) using data from different sensor placements, (ii) having access to users with data from heterogeneous sensor placements, (iii) considering bandwidth efficiency, and (iv) dealing with data with incorrect labels. Our results show that FL models suffer from a consistent performance deficit in comparison to their DL counterparts, but achieve these results with much better bandwidth efficiency. Furthermore, we observe that FL models exhibit very similar responses to those of DL models when exposed to data from heterogeneous sensor placements. Finally, we show that the FL models are more robust to data with incorrect labels than their centralized DL counterparts.  © 2013 IEEE.},

Big data is built with the possibility to improve the healthcare industry. Big data makes the interconnection between patients, wearable sensors, healthcare caregivers, and providers through the utilization of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and software. Most of the economic challenges in developing countries are caused by the healthcare sector, which occurs predominantly due to the increasing population requiring more quality of care concerning older people. Older people need great attention and care as they lead with irreparable damages when a minor accident or insignificant disease occurs. Therefore, the necessity of implementing new technologies and tools has arisen to support senior citizens regarding their healthcare. Various advancements in wireless technology, miniaturization, computing power, and processing made diverse healthcare innovations that led to developing the connected medical devices. Hence, this proposal develops a new healthcare monitoring system for tracking the activities of elderly people, where the Hadoop MapReduce technique for parallel processing the large-sized data. The data collected as mentioned in the available datasets is performed by using the numerous wearable sensors fixed on the ‘‘subject’s left ankle, right arm, and chest’’ that are transformed to the cloud platform and also to the data analytics layer according to the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices. The given input undergoes data splitting to produce tiny chunks. These small chunks of the input files are then considered as Map tasks. Here, in the map phase, the features are optimally selected by the Hybrid Dingo Coyote Optimization (HDCO). The combiner phase classifies the physical activities using the developed Deep Ensemble Learning (DEL) consisting of classifiers such as ‘‘Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN)’’. The parameter tuning in these classifiers is done by the same HDCO. The reducer phase extracts data from different chunks by merging the same classes. The developed HDCO-DEL has secured 13.66%, 16.01%, 17.33%, 13.6%, and 14.01% better accuracy than ELM, CNN, LSTM, DBN, DNN, and HealthFog, respectively on second dataset. The comparison with existing methods shows its better performance and also predicts physical activities with overall high accuracy. 2023 The Authors.

It is remarkably intricate to diagnose HD with disparate symptoms or features. With the augmentation in popularity of smart wearable gadgets, a chance to render an Internet of Things (IoT) solution has turned out to be more. Unfortunately, the survival rates are low for the people suffering from sudden heart attacks. Consequently, a patient monitoring scheme intended for heart patients utilizing IoT centered Deep Learning Modified Neural Network (DLMNN) is proposed to assist in the HD diagnosis, and medication is given accordingly. This proposed technique is executed via '3' steps: I) Authentication, ii) Encryption, and iii) Classification. First, by utilizing the substitution cipher (SC) together with the SHA-512, the heart patient of the specific hospital is authenticated. Subsequently, the wearable IoT sensor device, which is fixed to the patient's body, concurrently transmits the sensor data to the cloud. This sensor data is encrypted and securely transmitted to the cloud utilizing the PDH-AES technique. After that, the encrypted data is finally decrypted, and by employing the DLMNN classifier, the classification is done. The classified outcomes comprise '2'types of data: i) normal and ii) abnormal. It denotes the patient's heart condition and if the outcome is abnormal, an alert text is passed to the physician for treating the patient. The investigational outcomes are estimated and the DLMNN for HD diagnosis shows improvement as compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, the proposed PDH-AES used in support of secure data transmission results in the highest level of security i.e. 95.87%, and it is achieved in the lowest time for encryption along with decryption when weighted against the existent AES. © 2013 IEEE.},

This work aims to reduce data loss and latency when transmitting wearable sensor information to analysis terminals by introducing an innovative probabilistic transfer learning approach. Using dynamic transmission slot allocation based on risk thresholds and time sensitivity, the suggested method intelligently arranges and prioritizes the transfer of aggregate sensor data across various sources. High-risk data is given preference when allocating slots in a two-step algorithm that divides the data into emergency and normal classifications to guarantee timely delivery without undue delays. Over time, for better activity identification, the transfer model of learning steadily learns and improves the slot assignment accuracy based on feedback. Comprehensive analysis of various queuing scenarios and transmission disruptions shows notable improvements over existing approaches, with waiting times, data loss, and transmission delays reduced by up to 10.49%, 2.42%, and 13.86%, respectively. Most importantly, 3.28% more accuracy is achieved in identifying distinct activities from the supplied wearable sensor data. This can be achieved by the dependable data supply by the probabilistic modelling approach. With its comprehensive architecture for efficiently managing limited communication resources, the suggested approach can provide real-time health surveillance, smart environment services, and other digital-physical systems requiring trustworthy data streaming.

   abstract = {Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), which leverages the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) and autonomous systems, has grown in popularity recently. In RPM, the IoMT sense a patient’s biophysical data and transmits it in real time while the autonomous system processes the data for clinical notifications and storage. However, RPM deployments face two diverse challenges: how to present continuous data so that healthcare professionals can quickly interpret data streams and how to manage a great deal of missing data that occurs in RPM. Several studies suggested techniques for imputing missing data in static databases, which are unsuitable for RPM. A method for constantly streaming healthcare data to medical experts involves summarizing vital signs information into a numerical score, such as the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), which may be visually displayed to highlight MEWS patterns over a certain period. However, a MEWS chart is simplistic and more sophisticated ways to present data visually for straightforward interpretation are needed. This research proposes a solution for the visualization and missing data challenges by identifying patterns in the RPM data. First, a pattern-matching technique is proposed to address the missing data by considering the correlation and variability of the vital signs, resulting in a comparable correct match rate. Second, we transform the observed raw physiological vital signs data into concepts we call trust, frequency, trend, and slope parameters for visualization and automated alerts. The proposed approach can better support clinical decision-making than the MEWS. Comprehensive visualization approaches and missing data solutions can improve the quality and dependability of patient risk assessments.},

   abstract = {Healthcare is an area of concern where the application of human-centred design practices and principles can enormously affect well-being and patient care. The provision of high-quality healthcare services requires a deep understanding of patients’ needs, experiences, and preferences. Human activity recognition (HAR) is paramount in healthcare monitoring by using machine learning (ML), sensor data, and artificial intelligence (AI) to track and discern individuals’ behaviours and physical movements. This technology allows healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients, thereby ensuring they adhere to prescribed rehabilitation or exercise routines, and identify falls or anomalies, improving overall care and safety of the patient. HAR for healthcare monitoring, driven by deep learning (DL) algorithms, leverages neural networks and large quantities of sensor information to autonomously and accurately detect and track patients’ behaviors and physical activities. DL-based HAR provides a cutting-edge solution for healthcare professionals to provide precise and more proactive interventions, reducing the burden on healthcare systems and improving patient well-being while increasing the overall quality of care. Therefore, the study presents an improved coyote optimization algorithm with a deep learning-assisted HAR (ICOADL-HAR) approach for healthcare monitoring. The purpose of the ICOADL-HAR technique is to analyze the sensor information of the patients to determine the different kinds of activities. In the primary stage, the ICOADL-HAR model allows a data normalization process using the Z-score approach. For activity recognition, the ICOADL-HAR technique employs an attention-based long short-term memory (ALSTM) model. Finally, the hyperparameter tuning of the ALSTM model can be performed by using ICOA. The stimulation validation of the ICOADL-HAR model takes place using benchmark HAR datasets. The wide-ranging comparison analysis highlighted the improved recognition rate of the ICOADL-HAR method compared to other existing HAR approaches in terms of various measures.},

In addition, the 1-D CNN proposed accelerator operates very efficiently due to the use of a tristate buffer in the multiplexer and the substitution of the shift for the multiplier, resulting in a resource-efficient accelerator with 161 GOP/s/W energy efficiency and 28 GOP/s/KLUT, an improvement of 1.67 over the previous model.

By generating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices can consistently track the patient's heart rhythms. Although Cloud-based approaches for ECG analysis can achieve some levels of accuracy, they still have some limitations, such as high latency. Conversely, the Fog computing infrastructure is more powerful than edge devices but less capable than Cloud computing for executing compositionally intensive data analytic software. The Fog infrastructure can consist of Fog-based gateways directly connected with the wearable devices to offer many advanced benefits, including low latency and high quality of services. To address these issues, a modular one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) approach is proposed in this work. The inference module of the proposed approach is deployable over the Fog infrastructure for analysing the ECG signals and initiating the emergency countermeasures within a minimum delay, whereas its training module is executable on the computationally enriched Cloud data centers. The proposed approach achieves the F1-measure score ≈1 on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database when applying GridSearch algorithm with the cross-validation method. This approach has also been implemented on a single-board computer and Google Colab-based hybrid Fog-Cloud infrastructure and embodied to a remote patient monitoring system that shows 25% improvement in the overall response time.},

   abstract = {Recently, the techniques of Internet of Things (IoT) and mobile communications have been developed to gather human and environment information data for a variety of intelligent services and applications. Remote monitoring of elderly and disabled people living in smart homes is highly challenging due to probable accidents which might occur due to daily activities such as falls. For elderly people, fall is considered as a major reason for death of post-traumatic complication. So, early identification of elderly people falls in smart homes is needed to increase the survival rate of the person or offer required support. Recently, the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), IoT, wearables, smartphones, etc. makes it feasible to design fall detection systems for smart homecare. In this view, this paper presents an IoT enabled elderly fall detection model using optimal deep convolutional neural network (IMEFD-ODCNN) for smart homecare. The goal of the IMEFD-ODCNN model is to enable smartphones and intelligent deep learning (DL) algorithms to detect the occurrence of falls in the smart home. Primarily, the input video captured by the IoT devices is pre-processed in different ways like resizing, augmentation, and min-max based normalization. Besides, SqueezeNet model is employed as a feature extraction technique to derive appropriate feature vectors for fall detection. In addition, the hyperparameter tuning of the SqueezeNet model takes place using the salp swarm optimization (SSO) algorithm. Finally, sparrow search optimization algorithm (SSOA) with variational autoencoder (VAE), called SSOA-VAE based classifier is employed for the classification of fall and non-fall events. Finally, in case of fall event detected, the smartphone sends an alert to the caretakers and hospital management. The performance validation of the IMEFD-ODCNN model takes place on UR fall detection dataset and multiple cameras fall dataset. The experimental outcomes highlighted the promising performance of the IMEFD-ODCNN model over the recent methods with the maximum accuracy of 99.76% and 99.57% on the multiple cameras fall and UR fall detection dataset.},

Recently, wearable devices have become popular with wide applications in the health monitoring system which has stimulated the growth of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The IoMT has an important role to play in reducing the mortality rate by the early detection of disease. The prediction of heart disease is a key issue in the analysis of clinical dataset. The aim of the proposed investigation is to identify the key characteristics of heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. Many studies have focused on heart disease diagnosis, but the accuracy of the findings is low. Therefore, to improve prediction accuracy, an IoMT framework for the diagnosis of heart disease using modified salp swarm optimization (MSSO) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is proposed. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS improves the search capability using the Levy flight algorithm. The regular learning process in ANFIS is dependent on gradient-based learning and has a tendency to become trapped in local minima. The learning parameters are optimized utilizing MSSO to provide better results for ANFIS. The following information is taken from medical records to predict the risk of heart disease: blood pressure (BP), age, sex, chest pain, cholesterol, blood sugar, etc. The heart condition is identified by classifying the received sensor data using MSSO-ANFIS. A simulation and analysis is conducted to show that MSSA-ANFIS works well in relation to disease prediction. The results of the simulation demonstrate that the MSSO-ANFIS prediction model achieves better accuracy than the other approaches. The proposed MSSO-ANFIS prediction model obtains an accuracy of 99.45 with a precision of 96.54, which is higher than the other approaches.},

   abstract = {More adaptable and user-independent techniques are required for multi-sensors based daily locomotion detection (MS-DLD). This research study proposes a couple of locomotion detection methods using body-worn multi-sensors to successfully categorize several locomotion transitions. This research presents both standard and state-of-the-art methods for MS-DLD. Conventionally, to improve MS-DLD process, the proposed methodology consists of a wavelet transformed Quaternion-based filter for the inertial signals, patterns recognition in the form of kinematic-static energies, and state-of-the-art multi-features extraction. These features include entropy, spectral, and cepstral coefficients domains. Then, fuzzy logic-based optimization has been introduced in order to achieve the selective features by converting them into codewords. These nominated features with enhanced patterns are further detected by HMMs to improve the accuracy for classifying daily life locomotion actions. This paper also introduces another state-of-the-art way to model daily locomotion detection and derives body-specific modified HMMs. The model divides the sensor data into three active body-specific parts including head sensors, mid-body sensors, and lower body sensors. Body-specific modified HMMs have been provided with raw data for the three active body-specific sensors and gave better results with less computational complexities when compared to the conventional methods. The proposed systems have been experimentally assessed and trialed over three diverse publicly available datasets: the UP-Fall dataset consisting of falling and other daily life activities, the IM-WSHA dataset comprising everyday locomotion actions, and the ENABL3S gait and locomotion dataset consisting of multiple gait movements. Experimental outcomes indicate that the proposed conventional technique achieved improved results and outperformed existing systems based on detection accuracies of 90.0% and 87.5% over UP-Fall, 86.0% and 88.3% over IM-WSHA, and 86.7% and 90.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static energy patterns, respectively. Further, the results show that the state-of-the-art body-specific modified HMMs method achieved 94.3% and 95.0% over UP-Fall, 92.0% and 93.3% over IM-WSHA, and 90.0% and 95.0% over ENABL3S datasets for kinematic and static patterned signals, respectively.

Incorporating semantics in scene understanding has led to a deep understanding of human-centric actions. Therefore, in this research work, we propose a semantic HOI recognition system based on multi-vision sensors. In the proposed system, the de-noised RGB and depth images, via Bilateral Filtering (BLF), are segmented into multiple clusters using a Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm. The skeleton is then extracted from segmented RGB and depth images via Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT). Human joints, extracted from the skeleton, provide the annotations for accurate pixel-level labeling. An elliptical human model is then generated via a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). A Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is trained to allocate a specific label to each pixel of different human body parts and an interaction object. Two semantic feature types that are extracted from each labeled body part of the human and labelled objects are: Fiducial points and 3D point cloud. Features descriptors are quantized using Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) and classified using K-ary Tree Hashing (KATH). In experimentation phase the recognition accuracy achieved with the Sports dataset is 92.88%, with the Sun Yat-Sen University (SYSU) 3D HOI dataset is 93.5% and with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) RGB+D dataset it is 94.16%.

   abstract = {Intravenous (IV) therapy provides a rapid therapeutic effect. However, errors in infusion rate can lead to over-dosing and under-dosing, potentially causing severe side effects for patients. To prevent incidents, medical staff visually monitors medication injection information (MIF) such as current flow rates (CFR) and injection volume. In this study, we propose an internet of things (IoT) system that automatically controls the CFR and remotely monitors the MIF. First, a peristaltic pump is designed to infuse parenteral fluids based on the “drop-by-drop” phenomenon. Second, a computer vision-based on deep learning algorithm provides real-time video and counts the fluid dropping to derive the MIF. Finally, the CFR is automatically applied as a feedback signal to regulate the infusion cycle of the peristaltic pump. After embedding all systems in our prototype, we evaluate the system performance according to IV therapy protocols used in clinical practice. In our experiments, the mean accuracy of the fluid injection using the peristaltic pump was 99.23% and the dropping count was the highest at 98.25%. Furthermore, the average accuracy of the CFR using the feedback system was 99.3%. Based on our results, we confirmed that automated control of infusion rate is possible in IV therapy and computer vision-based on deep learning can be utilized for feedback sensors and monitoring system. Therefore, we believe that our method is the practical solution that can increase patient safety and work efficiency of clinical staffs.},

   abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is an attractive solution for non-contact vital sign monitoring due to its characteristics of robustness against noise, interference, and high-range resolutions. However, due to the attenuation of mmWave signal strength with distance, most previous methods require users to be relatively close to the radar (<2.5m), and the estimation of vital signs is inaccurate due to the influence of surrounding objects. In this paper, we propose a vital sign remote monitoring method based on mmWave sensing, which can estimate the heart rate of multiple users at a long distance. We first propose an object location detection method based on windowing minimum variance distortionless response to enhance the signal SNR from weak human body reflections and obtain fine-grained each user’s location. Then we design a vital sign estimation method based on wavelet packet decomposition to extract precision vital signs from composite reflection signals. We evaluate the system performance and the impact of different factors, including the distance, angle, and multi-user scenario. Experimental results show that our method can achieve the heart rate accurately with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.5Bpm and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 4% within 8m.},

Although, these technologies have increased the treatment’s precision but the growing number and the complexity of IoT healthcare devices are impacting accuracy along with several other challenges. Moreover, the use of different programming languages, operating platforms and data management methodologies are creating restrictions in safe exchange, integration and reuse of information across different applications. However, with the advent of the semantic web, the semantic technologies are growing in healthcare systems due to the capability of machine interpretation and processing by overcoming the restriction of languages and data heterogeneity. The most common shortcoming in the existing systems are the context-awareness and quality of services and the absence of rich patient ontology; leading towards low accuracy of results. To this aim, this paper provides a smart health framework, consisting on the collection and processing of IoT data (related to patient conditions and context). The framework is supported by the patient ontology along with SWRL rules for better decision making that consider different features (context-awareness and quality of services) differently that results in the improved accuracy. In the evaluation process the proposed work has achieved an accuracy of 89.81%. This work will help the practitioners to treat the patients in a better way.},

However, medical devices are usually challenging to deploy due to privacy regulations, and they generally leverage a centralized third party. Enabling data sharing would enhance new medical studies, formulate new treatments, and deliver new digital health technologies. Solving the issue will have a triple impact: we will handle sensitive information easily, contribute to international medical advancements, and enable personalized care. A possible solution is to exploit decentralization distributing privacy concerns directly to users. Solutions enabling this vision are closely linked to Distributed Ledger Technologies. Through its characteristics of immutability and transparency, this technology would allow privacy-compliant solutions in contexts where privacy is the first need. This paper envisions the InterPlanetary Health Layer and related real-world implementations in the Internet of Medical Things domain. The main idea of the proposed solution is to handle sensitive data by preserving privacy and guaranteeing data availability. Specifically, users can build their private network, collaboratively authorize operations among their data and manage their privacy conditions without relying on a third party. The results of several stress tests conducted on a real case study confirmed the feasibility of the proposed solution, which shows good scalability and a modest impact on the application performance measured during the decentralized data access.},

The proposed framework aims to aid in the health and fitness industry based on body vitals, body movement and health related data. The framework is expected to assist athletes, trainers and physicians with the interpretation of multiple physical signs and raise alerts in case of any health hazard. We proposed a method to collect and analyze exercise specific data which can be used to measure exercise intensity and its benefit to athlete's health and serve as recommendation system for upcoming athletes. We determined the validity of the proposed framework by giving a six weeks workout plan with six days a week for workout activity targeting all muscles followed by one day for recovery. We recorded the electrocardiogram, heart rate, heart rate variability, breath rate, and determined athlete's movement using a 3D-acceleration. The collected data in the research is used in two modules. A Health zone module implemented on body vitals data which categorizes athlete's health state into various categories. Hzone module is responsible for health hazards identification and alarming. Outstandingly, the Hzone module is able to identify an athlete's physical state with 97% accuracy. A gym activity recognition (GAR) module is implemented to recognize workout activity in real-time using body movements and body vitals data.

Existing technologies have brought forth a plethora of applications that could not have been imagined in the past years. B5G will enable us to rethink the capability it will offer in various sectors, including agriculture, search and rescue, and, more specifically, in the delivery of health-care services. Unobtrusive and noninvasive measurements using radio-frequency (RF) sensing, monitoring, and the control of wearable medical devices are the areas that would potentially benefit from B5G. Applications such as RF sensing, device charging, and remote patient monitoring will be a key challenge in using millimeter-wave (mm-wave) communication. The mm-waves experience multipath-induced fading, where the rate of attenuation is larger as compared to microwaves. Eventually, mm-wave communication systems would require range extenders and guided surfaces. A proposed solution is the use of intelligent reflective surfaces, which will have the ability to manipulate electromagnetic (EM) signals. These intelligent surfaces mounted and/or coated on walls, also known as intelligent walls (IWs), are planar and active surfaces, which will be a key element in B5G and 6G communication. These intelligent walls, equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and computation power, would have the ability to manipulate EM waves and act as gateways in the heterogeneous network environment. The article presents the application and vision of intelligent walls for next-generation health care in the era of B5G.},

The method is a compact end-to-end deep learning model which does not require feature engineering and can use low-cost raw photoplethysmography (PPG) as input signal. RRWaveNet was tested subject-independently and compared to baseline in four data sets (BIDMC, CapnoBase, WESAD, and SensAI) and using three window sizes (16, 32, and 64 s). RRWaveNet outperformed current state-of-the-art methods with mean absolute errors at an optimal window size of 1.66 ± 1.01, 1.59 ± 1.08, 1.92 ± 0.96, and 1.23 ± 0.61 breaths per minute for each data set. In remote monitoring settings, such as in the WESAD and SensAI data sets, we apply transfer learning to improve the performance using two other ICU data sets as pretraining data sets, reducing the MAE by up to 21%.

These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.},

Several studies attempted to detect the physiological value from the captured image using optical character recognition (OCR). However, the technology has limited availability with high cost. Thus, this study aimed to propose a novel framework called pandemic accelerated human-machine collaboration (PACMAN) with a low-resource deep learning-based computer vision. We compared state-of-the-art object detection algorithms (scaled YOLOv4, YOLOv5, and YOLOR), including the commercial OCR tools for digit recognition on the captured images from the pulse oximeter display. All images were derived from crowdsourced data collection with varying quality and alignment. YOLOv5 was the best performing model against the given model comparison across all data sets, notably the correctly orientated image data set. We further improved the model performance with the digits auto-orientation algorithm and applied a clustering algorithm to extract SpO2 and PR values. The accuracy performance of YOLOv5 with the implementations was approximately 81.0–89.5%, which was enhanced compared to without any additional implementation.

The edge detection involves vision-based detection using a compressed neural network running on a smart device constructed using transfer learning. Decision making in fog involves ensemble learning methodology using sensor-based data and decision from the edge. The cloud is used for permanent storage and model building. The work also takes advantage of image augmentation for data set building to improve the performance of the model. The model is evaluated based on accuracy, and the advantage of the fog layer is evaluated based on the latency. The proposed model gives an accuracy of 98.5% which is compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms available for detection.},

The ability to connect devices and collect data from them has the potential to transform the way it monitors and treat patients. However, the security and privacy of this data is a major concern. The cryptography and other conventional methods for security in resource constrained MIoT has several shortcomings. First, it does not provide adequate protection for patient data. Second, it is not designed to work with the large number of devices and huge volumes of data that are typically generated in MIoT applications. In this article, secure M-Trust privacy protocol (SMP) has been designed to address these issues. The SMP protocol uses a combination of trust, cryptographic, and machine learning techniques to provide security and privacy for data in transit. The SMP protocol has been designed to work with the smart health care monitoring system to provide a secure and private communication channel between devices in the system. The SMP protocol is an improvement over the existing security and privacy protocols for medical data. The simulation results proves that the SMP protocol is more efficient and scalable than the existing protocols. The SMP protocol is a valuable addition to the MIoT landscape and can help improve the privacy of data exchanged between medical devices.},

   abstract = {The need to improve smart health systems to monitor the health situation of patients has grown as a result of the spread of epidemic diseases, the ageing of the population, the increase in the number of patients, and the lack of facilities to treat them. This led to an increased demand for remote healthcare systems using biosensors. These biosensors produce a large volume of sensed data that will be received by the edge of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to be forwarded to the data centers of the cloud for further treatment. An edge-fog computing-enabled lossless electroencephalogram (EEG) data compression with epileptic seizure detection in IoMT networks is proposed in this article. The proposed approach achieves three functionalities. First, it reduces the amount of sent data from the edge to the fog gateway using lossless EEG data compression based on a hybrid approach of  k -means clustering and Huffman encoding (KCHE) at the edge gateway. Second, it decides the epileptic seizure situation of the patient at the fog gateway based on the epileptic seizure detector-based Naive Bayes (ESDNB) algorithm. Third, it reduces the size of IoMT EEG data delivered to the cloud using the same lossless compression algorithm in the first step. Various measures implemented to show the effectiveness of the suggested approach and the comparison results confirm that the KCHE reduces the amount of EEG data transmitted to the fog and cloud platform and produces a suitable detection of an epileptic seizure. The average of compression power of the proposed KCHE is four times the average of compression power of other methods for all EEG records ( Z, F, N, O , and  S ). Furthermore, the proposed ESDNB outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy, where it provides accuracy from 99.53 % up to 99.99 % using the data set of Bonn University.},

   abstract = {Objective: We developed a wearable watch-based device to provide noninvasive, cuff-less blood pressure (BP) estimation in an at-home setting. Methods: The watch measures single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), tri-axial seismocardiogram (SCG), and multi-wavelength photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals to compute the pulse transit time (PTT), allowing for BP estimation. We sent our custom watch device and an oscillometric BP cuff home with 21 healthy subjects, and captured the natural variability in BP over the course of a 24-hour period. Results: After calibration, our Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.69 and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.72 mmHg suggest that noninvasive PTT measurements correlate with around-the-clock BP. Using a novel two-point calibration method, we achieved a RMSE of 3.86 mmHg. We further demonstrated the potential of a semi-globalized adaptive model to reduce calibration requirements. Conclusion: This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that BP has been comprehensively estimated noninvasively using PTT in an at-home setting. We showed a more convenient method for obtaining ambulatory BP than through the use of the standard oscillometric cuff. We presented new calibration methods for BP estimation using fewer calibration points that are more practical for a real-world scenario. Significance: A custom watch (SeismoWatch) capable of taking multiple BP measurements enables reliable remote monitoring of daily BP and paves the way towards convenient hypertension screening and management, which can potentially reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life.  © 2013 IEEE.},

While a multitude of commercial wearables can detect activities of daily life, such as walking and running, they cannot accurately detect physical-therapy exercises. The goal of this study was to build open-source classifiers for remote physical-therapy monitoring and provide insight on how data collection choices may impact classifier performance. Methods: We trained and evaluated multi-class classifiers using data from 19 healthy adults who performed 37 exercises while wearing 10 inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the chest, pelvis, wrists, thighs, shanks, and feet. We investigated the effect of sensor density, location, type, sampling frequency, output granularity, feature engineering, and training-data size on exercise-classification performance. Results: Exercise groups (n = 10) could be classified with 96% accuracy using a set of 10 IMUs and with 89% accuracy using a single pelvis-worn IMU. Multiple sensor modalities (i.e., accelerometers and gyroscopes), high sampling frequencies, and more data from the same population did not improve model performance, but in the future data from diverse populations and better feature engineering could. Conclusions: Given the growing demand for exercise monitoring systems, our sensitivity analyses, along with open-source tools and data, should reduce barriers for product developers, who are balancing accuracy with product formfactor, and increase transparency and trust in clinicians and patients.},

Epilepsy, a chronic brain syndrome characterized by recurrent, unpredictable attacks, affects individuals of all ages. IoT-based seizure monitoring can greatly enhance seizure patients' quality of life. IoT device acquires patient data and transmits it to a computer program so that doctors can examine it. Currently, doctors invest significant manual effort in inspecting Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals to identify seizure activity. However, EEG-based seizure detection algorithms face challenges in real-world scenarios due to non-stationary EEG data and variable seizure patterns among patients and recording sessions. Therefore, a sophisticated computer-based approach is necessary to analyze complex EEG records. In this work, the authors proposed a hybrid approach by combining traditional convolution neural (CN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) along with an attention mechanism for the automatic recognition of epileptic seizures through EEG signal analysis. This attention mechanism focuses on significant subsets of EEG data for class recognition, resulting in improved model performance. The proposed methods are evaluated using a publicly available UCI epileptic seizure recognition dataset, which consists of five classes: four normal conditions and one abnormal seizure condition. Experimental results demonstrate that the suggested approach achieves an overall accuracy of 97.05% for the five-class EEG recognition data, with an accuracy of 99.52% for binary classification distinguishing seizure cases from normal instances. Furthermore, the proposed intelligent seizure recognition model is compatible with an IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) cloud-based smart healthcare framework.},

Frequent, unobtrusive assessment of naturalistic motor performance could enable clinicians to better assess rehabilitation effectiveness and monitor patients' recovery trajectories.

Eighteen stroke survivors were equipped with an inertial sensor on the stroke-affected wrist and performed up to four ADLs in a naturalistic manner. Continuous inertial time series were segmented into sliding windows, and a machine-learned model identified windows containing instances of point-to-point (P2P) movements. Using kinematic features extracted from the detected windows, a subsequent model was used to estimate upper-limb motor impairment, as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). Both models were evaluated using leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. The P2P movement detection model had an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.72. FMA estimates had a normalized root mean square error of 18.8% with R^2=0.72.

These methods aim to facilitate remote screening and monitoring of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19.

Subsequently, the multi-data fusion model integrates electronic records features with data from wearable human sensors. To optimize computational efficiency, a data reduction mechanism is added to eliminate unnecessary features. Furthermore, we employ a contingent probability method to estimate distinct feature weights for each cluster, deepening our understanding of variations in thermal and sensory data to assess the prediction of abnormal COVID-19 instances.

Recently, applications like e-healthcare monitoring has attracted wide attention from the research community, where both the security and the effectiveness of the system are greatly imperative. However, to the best of our knowledge none of the existing literature can accomplish both these objectives (e.g., existing systems are not secure against physical attacks). This paper addresses the shortcomings in existing IoT-based healthcare system. We propose an enhanced system by introducing a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication scheme and a data driven fault-tolerant decision-making scheme for designing an IoT-based modern healthcare system. Analyses show that our proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than existing systems. Hence, it will be useful in designing an advanced IoT-based healthcare system.},

   abstract = {Technological development expands the computation process of smart devices that adopt the telecare medical information system (TMIS) to fulfill the demands of the healthcare organization. It provides better medical identification to claim the features namely trustworthy, efficient, and resourceful. Moreover, the telecare services automate the remote healthcare monitoring process to ease professional workloads. Importantly, it is conceived to be more timesaving, economical, and easy healthcare access. Cloud-Based Medical Healthcare (CBMH) system is a standard platform that gives its support to the patients for emergency treatment from the medical experts over Internet communication. Since the medical records are very sensitive, security protection is much necessitated. In addition, patient anonymity should be well preserved. In 2016, Chiou et al. proposed a mutual authentication protocol for the Telecare Medical Information System (TMIS) using Cloud Environment (CE). They claim that their protocol satisfies patient anonymity. However, this paper proves that the Chiou et al. scheme is not only completely insecure against the patient anonymity, health-report revelation, health-report forgery, report confidentiality, and non-repudiation but also fails to validate the service access against verifiability, undeniability and unforgeability. In order to provide better mutual authenticity, this paper suggests the framework of smart service authentication to cross-examine the common secret session key among the communication entities. In order to examine the security properties, formal and informal verification was carried out. Lastly, to prove the security and performance efficiency of a system, the proposed SSA framework was implemented using FPGA and Moteiv TMote Sky-Mote. A proposed smart service authentication (SSA) framework is presented to ensure better data security between the patients and the physicians. The formal and informal security analysis proves the significance of the SSA framework model to withstand the security attacks such as health-report forgery, health-report revelation, server-spoofing etc. As a result, it is claimed that it can be well suited for TMIS.},

It paved the way for health-care systems to reaffirm their foundations by using different technologies such as sensors, wearables, mobile applications, drones, robots, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT). A lot of domains have been renovated such as diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring, as well as previously unprecedented domains such as contact tracing. Contact tracing, in conjunction with the emergence, spread, and public compliance for vaccines, was a critical step for controlling and limiting the spread of the pandemic. Traditional contact tracing is usually dependent on individuals ability to recall their interactions, which is challenging and yet not effective. Consequently, further development and usage of automated, privacy-preserving, digital contact-tracing was required. As the pandemic is coming to an end, it is vital to collect and learn the effective used technologies that aided in fighting the virus in order to be prepared for any future pandemics and to be aware of any literature gaps that must be filled. This paper surveys state-of-the-art architectures, platforms, and applications combating COVID-19 at each phase of the five basic contact tracing phases, including case identification, contacts identification and rapid exposure notification, surveillance, regular follow up and prevention. In addition, there is a phase of preparation and post-pandemic services for current and needed future technology that will aid in the fight against any incoming infectious diseases.},

The symmetrical metal patterns ensure isotropic reflectance within the 1.2–3.6-GHz range, enabling robust sensing even when the metamaterial is dispersed randomly on the soil. The degradation of the Mg antenna in the soil presents a significant reflection reduction from 80% to 20% at a 2.4-GHz resonant frequency on the soil, promoting the feasibility of combination with a simple wireless measurement system. Integration with functional coatings that dissolve in response to specific soil substances such as pH-sensitive hydroxyapatite leads to the development of biodegradable soil remote monitoring sensors, offering precise, sustainable land management.},

This meticulous training aims to enable the models to accurately identify various patient health states, with the KNN model achieving an average accuracy of 92%, while the SVM and SGD models attained even higher accuracies of 94% and 97%, respectively. These outcomes were rigorously validated against established health scoring systems, showcasing the models’ exceptional performance in multiclass classification scenarios.

Typically, real-time health monitoring is very crucial for COVID-19 patients to prevent their health from deteriorating. Conventional healthcare monitoring systems are manual and require patient input to start monitoring health. However, it is difficult for the patients to give input in critical conditions as well as at night. For instance, if the oxygen saturation level decreases during sleep, then it is difficult to monitor. Furthermore, there is a need for a system that monitors post-COVID effects as various vitals get affected, and there are chances of their failure even after the recovery. i-Sheet exploits these features and provides the health monitoring of COVID-19 patients based on their pressure on the bedsheet. It works in three phases: 1) sensing the pressure exerted by the patient on the bedsheet; 2) categorizing the data into groups (comfortable and uncomfortable) based on the fluctuations in the data; and 3) alerting the caregiver about the condition of the patient. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of i-Sheet in monitoring the health of the patient. i-Sheet effectively categorizes the condition of the patient with an accuracy of 99.3% and utilizes 17.5 W of the power. Furthermore, the delay involved in monitoring the health of patients using i-Sheet is 2 s which is very diminutive and is acceptable.},

The proposed OFS, as a low power consumption, noncontact, noninvasive real-time health monitoring instrument, has been developed into an effective health care monitoring method. However, when people need to monitor BCG for a long time, a large number of BCG data needs to be collected, which is time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, in this article, we proposed a novel deep learning model, termed BCGNET. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract the short-term dependence between multivariate loads. Then, the recurrent neural network (RNN) model is used to capture the long-term dependence of load sequence, and the ultra-long-term repetitive pattern of load sequence is fully studied by using the long-short term memory (LSTM) network with a recurrent skip. Finally, the autoregressive layer and full connection layer are used for combined prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BCGNET; the accuracy is 91.43% achieved by the proposed BCGNET compared with CNN (89.61%), RNN (89.88%) and multihead attention network (MHA-Net) (90.22%), and also show the proposed model has good performance in BCG prediction and assessment.},

   abstract = {Falling is one of the primary causes of firefighter casualties. Therefore, early fall detection, followed by reliable and timely notification, is vital to ensure the survival of firefighters. However, due to complex and diverse firefighting scenarios, current fall detection systems (FDSs) are inadequate, especially in terms of accuracy and real-time applications. Hence, in this study, a wearable pre-impact FDS (PIFDS) for firefighters is proposed. We also evaluated the feasibility of using machine learning (ML) and ensemble learning (EL) methods deployed on the edge node to simultaneously improve the real-time performance and accuracy. Moving thresholding method is introduced to overcome the class-imbalanced issue due to fewer samples acquired during the pre-impact (PI) phase. Based on 14 firefighters’ data collection, the experimental results revealed that a Decision Tree classifier with optimized parameters (DT-ED4) outperformed other ML and EL methods in a tradeoff between processing time and accuracy. The results also showed that our system can detect falls before the impact with an average lead time of 447.9 ms, sensitivity of 95.10%, and specificity of 97.99%. The system’s heterogeneous IoT network architecture facilitated remote monitoring and alerts that enabled the incident commander (IC) to execute the rescue mission immediately upon notification. This study enhances the practicability of PIFDS and extends the application range of PIFDS from healthcare to firefighting.},

   abstract = {Telemonitoring is the use of electronic devices such as smartphones to remotely monitor patients. It provides great convenience and enables timely medical decisions. To facilitate the decision making for each patient, a model is needed to translate the data collected by the patient’s smartphone into a predicted score for his/her disease severity. To train a robust predictive model, semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides a viable approach by integrating both labeled and unlabeled samples to leverage all the available data from each patient. There are two challenging issues that need to be simultaneously addressed in using SSL for this problem: (1) feature selection from high-dimensional noisy telemonitoring data; and (2) instance selection from many, possibly redundant unlabeled samples. We propose a novel SSL model allowing for simultaneous feature and instance selection, namely the S2SSL model. We present a real-data application of telemonitoring for patients with Parkinson’s Disease using their smartphone-collected activity data such as tapping and speaking. A total of 382 features were extracted from the activity data of each patient. 74 labeled and 563 unlabeled instances from 37 patients were used to train S2SSL. The trained model achieved a high accuracy of 0.828 correlation between the true and predicted disease severity scores on a validation dataset. Note to Practitioners—Telemonitoring is an emerging health care platform enabled by smartphones and wearables. Because it allows for health data to be collected anytime and anywhere, patients can be frequently monitored and medical decisions can be made more timely and effectively. This paper addresses the data science challenges in leveraging the telemonitoring platform to benefit patient care. Specifically, we propose a new model, S2SSL, to tackle these challenges and provide better robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper may be interesting to health care practitioners seeking advanced analytics capabilities to model and integrate the data collected through telemonitoring devices, with ultimate purposes of improving the decision in treating each patient and increasing patient access to specialized care.},

Machine learning techniques have been proposed as a potential solution, however, they are less interpretable and generalizable when compared to physics-based techniques. Herein, we propose a hybrid method utilizing inertial sensor- and electromyography (EMG)-driven simulation of muscle contraction to characterize knee joint and muscle mechanics during walking gait. Machine learning is used only to map a subset of measured muscle excitations to a full set thereby reducing the number of required sensors. We demonstrate the utility of the approach for estimating net knee flexion moment (KFM) as well as individual muscle moment and work during the stance phase of gait across nine unimpaired subjects. Across all subjects, KFM was estimated with 0.91%BW•H RMSE and strong correlations (r = 0.87) compared to ground truth inverse dynamics analysis. Estimates of individual muscle moments were strongly correlated (r = 0.81–0.99) with a reference EMG-driven technique using optical motion capture and a full set of electrodes as were estimates of muscle work (r = 0.88–0.99). Implementation of the proposed technique in the current work included instrumenting only three muscles with surface electrodes (lateral and medial gastrocnemius and vastus medialis) and both the thigh and shank segments with inertial sensors. These sensor locations permit instrumentation of a knee brace/sleeve facilitating a practically deployable mechanism for monitoring muscle and joint mechanics with performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art.},

   abstract = {Objective: Tracking changes in hemodynamic congestion and the consequent proactive readjustment of treatment has shown efficacy in reducing hospitalizations for patients with heart failure (HF). However, the cost-prohibitive nature of these invasive sensing systems precludes their usage in the large patient population affected by HF. The objective of this research is to estimate the changes in pulmonary artery mean pressure (PAM) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) following vasodilator infusion during right heart catheterization (RHC), using changes in simultaneously recorded wearable seismocardiogram (SCG) signals captured with a small wearable patch. Methods: A total of 20 patients with HF (20% women, median age 55 (interquartile range (IQR), 44-64) years, ejection fraction 24 (IQR, 16-43)) were fitted with a wearable sensing patch and underwent RHC with vasodilator challenge. We divided the dataset randomly into a training–testing set (n = 15) and a separate validation set (n = 5). We developed globalized (population) regression models to estimate changes in PAM and PCWP from the changes in simultaneously recorded SCG. Results: The regression model estimated both pressures with good accuracies: root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 2.5 mmHg and R2 of 0.83 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 1.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.93 for estimating changes in PCWP for the training-testing set, and RMSE of 2.7 mmHg and R2 of 0.81 for estimating changes in PAM, and RMSE of 2.9 mmHg and R2 of 0.95 for estimating changes in PCWP for the validation set respectively. Conclusion: Changes in wearable SCG signals may be used to track acute changes in intracardiac hemodynamics in patients with HF. Significance: This method holds promise in tracking longitudinal changes in hemodynamic congestion in hemodynamically-guided remote home monitoring and treatment for patients with HF.},

   abstract = {Objective: Ambulatory monitoring of ground reaction force (GRF) and center of pressure (CoP) could improve management of health conditions that impair mobility. Insoles instrumented with force-sensitive resistors (FSRs) are an unobtrusive, low-cost, and low-power technology for sampling GRF and CoP in real-world environments. However, FSRs have variable response characteristics that complicate estimation of GRF and CoP. This study introduces a unique data analytic pipeline that enables accurate estimation of GRF and CoP despite relatively inaccurate FSR responses. This paper also investigates whether inclusion of a complementary knee angle sensor improves estimation accuracy. Methods: Seventeen healthy subjects were equipped with an insole instrumented with six FSRs and a string-based knee angle sensor. Subjects walked in a straight line at self-selected slow, preferred, and fast speeds over an in-ground force platform. Twenty repetitions were performed for each speed. Supervised machine learning models estimated weight-normalized GRF and shoe size-normalized CoP, which were re-scaled to obtain GRF and CoP. Results: Anteroposterior GRF, Vertical GRF, and Anteroposterior CoP were estimated with a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of less than 5%. Mediolateral GRF and CoP were estimated with an NRMSE of 8.1% and 6.4%, respectively. Knee angle-related features slightly improved GRF estimates. Conclusion: Normalized models accurately estimated GRF and CoP despite deficiencies in FSR data. Significance: Ambulatory use of the proposed system could enable objective, longitudinal monitoring of severity and progression for a variety of health conditions.},

   abstract = {Objective: With the increasing use of wearable healthcare devices for remote patient monitoring, reliable signal quality assessment (SQA) is required to ensure the high accuracy of interpretation and diagnosis on the recorded data from patients. Photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals non-invasively measured by wearable devices are extensively used to provide information about the cardiovascular system and its associated diseases. In this study, we propose an approach to optimize the quality assessment of the PPG signals. Methods: We used an ensemble-based feature selection scheme to enhance the prediction performance of the classification model to assess the quality of the PPG signals. Our approach for feature and subset size selection yielded the best-suited feature subset, which was optimized to differentiate between the clean and artifact corrupted PPG segments. Conclusion: A high discriminatory power was achieved between two classes on the test data by the proposed feature selection approach, which led to strong performance on all dependent and independent test datasets. We achieved accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates of higher than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, for dependent test datasets, independent of heartbeat type, i.e., atrial fibrillation (AF) or non-AF data including normal sinus rhythm (NSR), premature atrial contraction (PAC), and premature ventricular contraction (PVC). For independent test datasets, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates were greater than 0.93, 0.89, and 0.97, respectively, on PPG data recorded from AF and non-AF subjects. These results were found to be more accurate than those of all of the contemporary methods cited in this work. Significance: As the results illustrate, the advantage of our proposed scheme is its robustness against dynamic variations in the PPG signal during long-term 14-day recordings accompanied with different types of physical activities and a diverse range of fluctuations and waveforms caused by different individual hemodynamic characteristics, and various types of recording devices. This robustness instills confidence in the application of the algorithm to various kinds of wearable devices as a reliable PPG signal quality assessment approach.},

Federated learning (FL) is one of the solutions to user privacy and provides distributed training among several local devices. In addition, it reduces the computation and bandwidth of transferring videos to the central server in camera-based IoMT devices. In this work, we design an edge-based federated framework for such devices. In contrast to traditional methods that drop the resource-constrained stragglers in a federated round, our system provides a methodology to incorporate them. We propose a new phase in the FL algorithm, known as split learning. The stragglers train collaboratively with the nearest edge node using split learning. We test the implementation using heterogeneous computing devices that extract vital signs from videos. The results show a reduction of 3.6 h in the training time of videos using the split learning phase with respect to the traditional approach. We also evaluate the performance of the devices and system with key parameters, CPU utilization, memory consumption, and data rate. Furthermore, we achieve 87.29% and 60.26% test accuracy at the nonstragglers and stragglers, respectively, with a global accuracy of 90.32% at the server. Therefore, FedCare provides a straggler-resistant federated method for a heterogeneous system for social IoMT devices.},

Unluckily, the AP actuator, an insulin pump, is subject to failures, with potentially serious consequences for subject safety. This calls for the development of advanced monitoring systems, leveraging the unprecedented data availability. This paper tackles for the first time the problem of automatically detecting pump faults with multidimensional data-driven anomaly detection (AD) methodologies. The approach allows to avoid the subtask of identifying a physiological model, typical of model-based approaches. Furthermore, we employ unsupervised methods, removing the need of labeled data for training, hardly available in practice. The adopted data-driven AD methods are local outlier factor, connectivity-based outlier factor, and isolation forest. Moreover, we propose a modification of these methods to cope with the dynamic nature of the underlying problem. The algorithms were tuned and tested on: 1) two-synthetic 100-patients' data set, of one-month data each, generated using the “UVA/Padova T1D Simulator,” a large-scale nonlinear computer simulator of T1D subject physiology, largely adopted in AP research and accepted by the American Food and Drug Administration as a replacement of preclinical animal trials for AP and 2) a real 7-patients' data set consisting of one month in free-living conditions. The satisfactory accuracy of the proposed approach paves the way to the embedding of these methodologies in AP systems or their deployment in remote monitoring systems.},

This network paradigm consists of a cloud-centric network and several Cybertwin communication ends. The Cybertwin nodes combine support locator/identifier identification, data caching, behavior logger, and communications assistant in the edge cloud. The application focuses on monitoring the ECG patterns during daily activity because few studies analyze them under different motions. We present a novel deep convolutional neural network based human activity recognition classifier to enhance identification accuracy. The healthcare monitoring values and potential clinical medicine are provided by the Cybertwin based network for ECG patterns observing.},

   abstract = {Owing to increasing connected medical devices and rapid development of deep learning technologies, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has attracted great attention for healthcare monitoring with intelligent sensors. Radar serves as a non-contact healthcare device, continuously measuring human’s vital signs and behavior to provide daily and comprehensive long-term record on health status. However, radar sensor data collected from various users and families usually involve sensitive personal information, while traditional deep learning technologies using IoMT radar data may present high privacy leakage risks. This paper proposes FedRadar, a novel federated multi-task transfer learning framework for radar-based heartbeat rate and activity monitoring in IoMT to solve these challenges. It deals with the decentralized structure, training personalized multi-task models collaboratively, combining the shared relevance knowledge of human’s physiological information while keeping personal radar data locally for privacy protection. First, the multi-task neural network is built on the spatial-temporal radar data to capture the potential relationship and shared representations between human’s vital sign and activity. Furthermore, the federated learning with knowledge transfer scheme is designed to achieve personalized local models by transferring coarse relevant features and keeping fine-grained individual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of FedRadar with 2.8% and 2.5% superior than local training model respectively on the accuracy of heartbeat rate estimation and activity classification in realistic constructed radar datasets. In addition, FedRadar is extensible and suitable to continuously monitor multiple health indicators with privacy protection in IoMT. The FedRadar codes and constructed radar datasets are available on https://github.com/bupt-uwb/FedRadar.},

Machine learning models trained on wearable sensor data from scripted activities performed by participants in the lab and clinician ratings of the video recordings of these tasks identified tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia in the supervised lab environment with a balanced accuracy of 83%, 75%, and 81%, respectively, when compared to the clinician ratings. The performance of the same models when evaluated on data from subjects performing unscripted activities unsupervised in their own homes achieved a balanced accuracy of 63%, 63%, and 67%, respectively, in comparison to self-assessment patient diaries, further highlighting their limitations. The ankle-worn sensor was found to be advantageous for the detection of dyskinesias but did not show an added benefit for tremor and bradykinesia detection here.},

   abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease affecting millions worldwide. Bespoke subject-specific treatment (medication or deep brain stimulation (DBS)) is critical for management, yet depends on precise assessment cardinal PD symptoms - bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor. Clinician diagnosis is the basis of treatment, yet it allows only a cross-sectional assessment of symptoms which can vary on an hourly basis and is liable to inter- and intra-rater subjectivity across human examiners. Automated symptomatic assessment has attracted significant interest to optimise treatment regimens between clinician visits, however, no wearable has the capacity to simultaneously assess all three cardinal symptoms. Challenges in the measurement of rigidity, mapping muscle activity out-of-clinic and sensor fusion have inhibited translation. In this study, we address all through a novel wearable sensor system and machine learning algorithms. The sensor system is composed of a force-sensor, three inertial measurement units (IMUs) and four custom mechanomyography (MMG) sensors. The system was tested in its capacity to predict Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores based on quantitative assessment of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor in PD patients. 23 PD patients were tested with the sensor system in parallel with exams conducted by treating clinicians and 10 healthy subjects were recruited as a comparison control group. Results prove the system accurately predicts UPDRS scores for all symptoms (85.4% match on average with physician assessment) and discriminates between healthy subjects and PD patients (96.6% on average). MMG features can also be used for remote monitoring of severity and fluctuations in PD symptoms out-of-clinic. This closed-loop feedback system enables individually tailored and regularly updated treatment, facilitating better outcomes for a very large patient population.},

   abstract = {Estimation of muscle excitations from a reduced sensor array could greatly improve current techniques in remote patient monitoring. Such an approach could allow continuous monitoring of clinically relevant biomechanical variables that are ideal for personalizing rehabilitation. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a muscle synergy function which describes the synergistic relationship between a subset of muscles. We develop from first principles an approximation to their behavior using Gaussian process regression and demonstrate the utility of the technique for estimating the excitation time-series of leg muscles during normal walking for nine healthy subjects. Specifically, excitations for six muscles were estimated using surface electromyography (sEMG) data during a finite time interval (called the input window) from four different muscles (called the input muscles) with mean absolute error (MAE) less than 5.0% of the maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) and that accounts for 82-88% of the variance (VAF) in the true excitations. Further, these estimated excitations informed muscle activations with less than 4.0% MAE and 89-93% VAF. We also present a detailed analysis of a number of different modeling choices, including every possible combination of four-, three- and two-muscle input sets, the size and structure of the input window, and the stationarity of the Gaussian process covariance functions. Further, application specific modifications for future use are discussed. The proposed technique lays a foundation to explore the use of reduced wearable sensor arrays and muscle synergy functions for monitoring clinically relevant biomechanics during daily life.},

   abstract = {Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.},

poorly understood group of patients both clinically and
immunologically. We investigated differences in prognosis and
candidate immune biomarkers in patients with unknown compared
with those with known primary melanoma enrolled in the E1609
adjuvant trial that tested ipilimumab at 3 and 10 mg/kg vs
high-dose interferon-alfa (HDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUP
status was defined as initial presentation with cutaneous, nodal
or distant metastasis without a known primary. Relapse-free
survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by
the Kaplan-Meier method. Stratified (by stage) log-rank test was
used to compare RFS and OS by primary tumor status. Gene
expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the tumor biopsies
of a subset of patients. Similarly, peripheral blood samples
were tested for candidate soluble and cellular immune
biomarkers. RESULTS: MUP cases represented 12.8% of the total
population (N=1699) including 11.7% on the ipilimumab arms and
14.7% on the HDI arm. Stratifying by stage, RFS (p=0.001) and
overall survival (OS) (p=0.009) showed outcomes significantly
better for patients with unknown primary. The primary tumor
status remained prognostically significant after adjusting for
treatment and stage in multivariate Cox proportional hazards
models. Including only ipilimumab-treated patients, RFS
(p=0.005) and OS (p=0.023) were significantly better in favor of
those with unknown primary. Among patients with GEP data (n=718;
102 MUP, 616 known), GEP identified pathways and genes related
to autoimmunity, inflammation, immune cell infiltration and
immune activation that were significantly enriched in the MUP
tumors compared with known primaries. Further investigation into
infiltrating immune cell types estimated significant enrichment
with CD8 +and CD4+T cells, B cells and NK cells as well as
significantly higher major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I
and MHC-II scores in MUP compared with known primary. Among
patients tested for circulating biomarkers (n=321; 66 unknown
and 255 known), patients with MUP had significantly higher
circulating levels of IL-2R (p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Patients with
MUP and high-risk melanoma had significantly better prognosis
and evidence of significantly enhanced immune activation within
the TME and the circulation, supporting the designation of MUP
as a distinct prognostic marker in patients with high-risk
melanoma.},

mean AHI of 50 (SD 27), and 13% (8/60) were women. Patients in
the intervention arm had a mean (95% CI) of 1.14 (0.04-2.23)
hours/day higher adjusted CPAP compliance than controls
(P=.047). Patients' satisfaction was excellent in both arms, and
up to 88% (15/17) of intervention patients reported willingness
to keep using the MiSAOS app in the future. No significant
differences were found in costs (control: mean €90.2 (SD 53.14)
(US 105.76 [SD 62.31]); intervention: mean €96.2 (SD 62.13)
(US 112.70 [SD 72.85]); P=.70; €1=US 1.17 was considered
throughout). Overall costs combined with results on compliance
demonstrated cost-effectiveness in a bootstrap-based simulation
analysis. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning-based intelligent
monitoring system increased daily compliance, reported excellent
patient satisfaction similar to that reported in usual care, and
did not incur in a substantial increase in costs, thus proving
cost-effectiveness. This study supports the implementation of
intelligent eHealth frameworks for the management of patients
with CPAP-treated OSA and confirms the value of patients'
empowerment in the management of chronic diseases. TRIAL

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subtle abnormal motor signs are indications of
serious neurological diseases. Although neurological deficits
require fast initiation of treatment in a restricted time, it is
difficult for nonspecialists to detect and objectively assess the
symptoms. In the clinical environment, diagnoses and decisions
are based on clinical grading methods, including the National
Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score or the Medical
Research Council (MRC) score, which have been used to measure
motor weakness. Objective grading in various environments is
necessitated for consistent agreement among patients, caregivers,
paramedics, and medical staff to facilitate rapid diagnoses and
dispatches to appropriate medical centers. OBJECTIVE: In this
study, we aimed to develop an autonomous grading system for
stroke patients. We investigated the feasibility of our new
system to assess motor weakness and grade NIHSS and MRC scores of
4 limbs, similar to the clinical examinations performed by
medical staff. METHODS: We implemented an automatic grading
system composed of a measuring unit with wearable sensors and a
grading unit with optimized machine learning. Inertial sensors
were attached to measure subtle weaknesses caused by paralysis of
upper and lower limbs. We collected 60 instances of data with
kinematic features of motor disorders from neurological
examination and demographic information of stroke patients with
NIHSS 0 or 1 and MRC 7, 8, or 9 grades in a stroke unit. Training
data with 240 instances were generated using a synthetic minority
oversampling technique to complement the imbalanced number of
data between classes and low number of training data. We trained
2 representative machine learning algorithms, an ensemble and a
support vector machine (SVM), to implement auto-NIHSS and
auto-MRC grading. The optimized algorithms performed a 5-fold
cross-validation and were searched by Bayes optimization in 30
trials. The trained model was tested with the 60 original
hold-out instances for performance evaluation in accuracy,
sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating
characteristics curve (AUC). RESULTS: The proposed system can
grade NIHSS scores with an accuracy of 83.3% and an AUC of 0.912
using an optimized ensemble algorithm, and it can grade with an
accuracy of 80.0% and an AUC of 0.860 using an optimized SVM
algorithm. The auto-MRC grading achieved an accuracy of 76.7%
and a mean AUC of 0.870 in SVM classification and an accuracy of
78.3% and a mean AUC of 0.877 in ensemble classification.
CONCLUSIONS: The automatic grading system quantifies proximal
weakness in real time and assesses symptoms through automatic
grading. The pilot outcomes demonstrated the feasibility of
remote monitoring of motor weakness caused by stroke. The system
can facilitate consistent grading with instant assessment and
expedite dispatches to appropriate hospitals and treatment
initiation by sharing auto-MRC and auto-NIHSS scores between
prehospital and hospital responses as an objective observation.},

   abstract = {Background: Hyperkalemia, characterized by elevated serum potassium levels, heightens the risk of sudden cardiac death, particularly increasing risk for individuals with chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Traditional laboratory test monitoring is resource-heavy, invasive, and unable to provide continuous tracking. Wearable technologies like smartwatches with electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities are emerging as valuable tools for remote monitoring, potentially allowing for personalized monitoring with artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG interpretation. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to develop an AI-ECG algorithm to predict serum potassium level in ESRD patients with smartwatch-generated ECG waveforms. Methods: A cohort of 152,508 patients with 293,557 ECGs paired serum potassium levels obtained within 1 hour at Cedars Sinai Medical Center was used to train an AI-ECG model (“Kardio-Net”) to predict serum potassium level. The model was further fine-tuned on 4,337 ECGs from 1,463 patients with ESRD using inputs from 12- and single-lead ECGs. Kardio-Net was evaluated in held-out test cohorts from Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Stanford Healthcare (SHC) as well as a prospective international cohort of 40 ESRD patients with smartwatch ECGs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Results: The Kardio-Net, when applied to 12-lead ECGs, identified severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) with an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.745-0.956) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.527 mEq/L. In external validation at SHC, the model achieved an AUC of 0.849 (95% CI: 0.823-0.875) and an MAE of 0.599 mEq/L. For single-lead ECGs, Kardio-Net detected severe hyperkalemia with an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.765-0.987) in the primary cohort and had an MAE of 0.575 mEq/L. In the external SHC validation, the AUC was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.778-0.835) with an MAE of 0.740 mEq/L. Using prospectively obtained smartwatch data, the AUC was 0.831 (95% CI: 0.693-0.975), with an MAE of 0.580 mEq/L. Conclusions: We validate a deep learning model to predict serum potassium levels from both 12-lead ECGs and single-lead smartwatch data, demonstrating its utility for remote monitoring of hyperkalemia. © 2024 American College of Cardiology Foundation},

   abstract = {Blood pressure issues are related to many illnesses threatening human health and require continuous control and monitoring. Health telemonitoring is an innovative solution allowing wellbeing and increasing autonomy of patients. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are a viable method used in recent studies for analyzing, predicting, and classifying health data while improving the health conditions of telemonitoring and telediagnosis. The main purpose of this article is to employ machine learning algorithms for Blood Pressure (BP) measurement classification in real-time. Data is gathered from the human body through a multilevel Wireless Medical Sensors Network (WMSN) architecture that is deployed to acquire, analyze, and monitor BP remotely. The first layer of the proposed architecture performs BP measurement, classification, and transmission to the second layer using a wearable sensor. The learning of classifiers is established with Cross-Validation to avoid over-fitting and to improve the performance while comparing the Decision Tree, K-Nearest-Neighbors, and Naive Bayes algorithms. Afterward, the best classifier is implemented in the BP sensor node to identify the BP status. The second layer is responsible for data aggregation in the Cloud and alerting when an anomaly occurs in BP measurement. The third layer is configured to present BP information continuously to the health professionals and patients using the Internet of Things (IoT) platform that retrieves data from the cloud. The evaluation results show better accuracy, i.e. 97.9% using the decision tree classifier. An experimental trial is carried out and the timing of 49 seconds is reached between BP measurement and the display of data on the IoT platform. Besides, the system was tested in real-time trials and produced an accurate classification of each measured BP. The obtained results approve the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of BP measurement, analysis, transmission, and supervision in real-time. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Joint angle quantification from inertial measurement units (IMUs) is commonly performed using kinematic modelling, which depends on anatomical sensor placement and/or functional joint calibration; however, accurate three-dimensional joint motion measurement remains challenging to achieve. The aims of this study were firstly to employ deep neural networks to convert IMU data to ankle joint angles that are indistinguishable from those derived from motion capture-based inverse kinematics (IK) - the reference standard; and secondly, to validate the robustness of this approach across contrasting walking speeds in healthy individuals. Kinematics data were simultaneously calculated using IMUs and IK from 9 subjects during walking on a treadmill at 0.5 m/s, 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. A generative adversarial network was trained using gait data at two of the walking speeds to predict ankle kinematics from IMU data alone for the third walking speed. There were significant differences between IK and IMU joint angle predictions for ankle eversion and internal rotation during walking at 0.5 m/s and 1.0 m/s (p < 0.001); however, no significant differences in joint angles were observed between the generative adversarial network prediction and IK at any speed or plane of joint motion (p < 0.05). The RMS difference in ankle joint kinematics between the generative adversarial network and IK for walking at 1.0 m/s was 3.8°, 2.1° and 3.5° for dorsiflexion, inversion and axial rotation, respectively. The modeling approach presented for real-time IMU to ankle joint angle conversion, which can be readily expanded to other joints, may provide enhanced IMU capability in applications such as telemedicine, remote monitoring and rehabilitation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare.},

With the help of the machine learning algorithm Support Vector Regression (SVR), the SMS fiber sensor can continuously and accurately monitor the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Commercial sphygmomanometers are used to calibrate the accuracy of blood pressure measurement. Compared with the single-channel system, this system can extract more pulse wave features for blood pressure prediction, such as radial artery transit time (RPTT), brachial artery transit time (BPTT), and the transit time difference between the radial artery and the brachial artery (DBRPTT). The results show that the performance of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring is more accurate than that of single-channel blood pressure monitoring in terms of the absolute value of the correlation coefficient (R) and the average value of the difference between SBP and DBP. In addition, both the single-channel and dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are in line with the Association for the Advancement of Medical Devices (AAMI), but the average deviation (DM, 0.06 mmHg) and standard deviation (SD, 1.54 mmHg) of dual-channel blood pressure monitoring are more accurate.

Here, we designed and synthesized a wide linear range and fast response strain sensor based on ionic conductive hydrogels (PVA-CS-PA hydrogels) using biodegradable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan (CS) as the polymer backbone, and biogenic phytic acid (PA) as the crosslinker. PVA-CS-PA hydrogels are tough and ductile. The hydrogel with a volume ratio of 3 : 2 for PA : H2O (PVA-CS-3PA-2 hydrogel), had a stretchability of 915 ± 32.44%, strength of 6.02 ± 0.18 MPa, and fracture energy of 5.28 ± 0.24 kJ m−2. It was also thermoplastic and anti-drying (more than 90% water retention after 30 days). The hydrogel-based strain sensor displayed a wide linear working range up to 900% strain, a fast response time within 50 ms, and reliable stability to detect subtle and large motions. Moreover, its sensing performance is maintained well after a thermoplastic process and long-term storage, suggesting it has reusability and a long lifetime. This tough, wide linear range, fast response, green, and recyclable hydrogel-based strain sensor is expected to pave the way for the development of environmentally friendly and high-performance artificial intelligence in versatile electronic applications. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Respiration rate is a vital parameter which is useful for the earlier identification of diseases. In this context, various types of devices have been fabricated and developed to monitor different breath rates. However, the disposability and biocompatibility of such sensors and the poor classification of different breath rates from sensor data are significant issues in medical services. This report attempts to focus on two important things: the classification of respiration signals from sensor data using deep learning and the disposability of devices. The use of the novel Janus MoSSe quantum dot (MoSSe QD) structure allows for stable respiration sensing because of unchanged wear rates under humid conditions, and also, the electron affinity and work function values suggest that MoSSe has a higher tendency to donate electrons and interact with the hydrogen molecule. Furthermore, for the real-time classification of different respiration signals, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D CNN) was incorporated. This algorithm was applied to four different breath patterns which achieved a state-of-the-art 10-trial accuracy of 98.18% for normal, 95.25% for slow, 97.64% for deep, and 98.18% for fast breaths. The successful demonstration of a stable, low-cost, and disposable respiration sensor with a highly accurate classification of signals is a major step ahead in developing wearable respiration sensors for future personal healthcare monitoring systems. © 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.

However, it remains a critical challenge for hydrogel-based epidermal sensors to simultaneously achieve self-healing capability, self-adhesiveness and long-lasting moisture retention for full-scale human motion biomonitoring. Herein, a conductive, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel is prepared from the conformal coating of the MXene nanosheet network by the polymer networks of dopamine grafted sodium alginate (Alg-DA), phenylboronic acid grafted sodium alginate (Alg-PBA) and polyacrylamide (PAAm) with a glycerol/water binary solvent as the dispersion medium. The obtained MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel exhibits excellent self-healing capability, superior self-adhesive performance and long-lasting moisture retention (10 days). Furthermore, the MXene nanocomposite organohydrogel can be assembled as a wearable epidermal sensor to detect human motion including large deformation (finger bending and wrist bending) and tiny deformation (swallowing, breathing, and pulse) with durable stability. Meanwhile, the assembled epidermal sensor could be employed to monitor human activities wirelessly via connecting a wireless transmitter. This work sheds new light on the development of flexible, self-healing, adhesive and long-lastingly moist epidermal sensors and electronic skins for personalized healthcare monitoring, human-machine interfaces, and artificial intelligence.

   abstract = {Background: The proportion of very old adults in the population is increasing, representing a significant challenge. Due to their vulnerability, there is a higher frequency of unplanned hospitalizations in this population, leading to adverse events. Digital tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) can help to identify early signs of vulnerability and unfavorable health events and can contribute to earlier and optimized management. Objective: This study aims to report the implementation in assisted living facilities of an innovative monitoring system (Presage Care) for predicting the short-term risk of emergency hospitalization. We describe its use and assess its performance. Methods: An uncontrolled multicenter intervention study was conducted between March and August 2022 in 7 assisted living facilities in France that house very old and vulnerable adults. The monitoring system was set up to provide alerts in cases of a high risk of emergency hospitalization. Nurse assistants (NAs) at the assisted living facilities used a smartphone app to complete a questionnaire on the functional status of the patients, comprising electronic patient-reported outcome measures (ePROMs); these were analyzed in real time by a previously designed machine learning algorithm. This remote monitoring of patients using ePROMs allowed notification of a coordinating nurse or a coordinating NA who subsequently informed the patient’s nurses or physician. The primary outcomes were the acceptability and feasibility of the monitoring system in the context and confirmation of the effectiveness and efficiency of AI in risk prevention and detection in practical, real-life scenarios. The secondary outcome was the hospitalization rate after alert-triggered interventions.Results: In this study, 118 of 194 (61%) eligible patients were included who had at least 1 follow-up visit. A total of 38 emergency hospitalizations were documented. The system generated 92 alerts for 47 of the 118 (40%) patients. Of these 92 alerts, 46 (50%) led to 46 health care interventions for 14 of the 118 (12%) patients and resulted in 4 hospitalizations. The other 46 of the 92 (50%) alerts did not trigger a health care intervention and resulted in 25 hospitalizations (P<.001). Almost all hospitalizations were associated with a lack of alert-triggered interventions (P<.001). System performance to predict hospitalization had a high specificity (96%) and negative predictive value (99.4%).Conclusions: The Presage Care system has been implemented with success in assisted living facilities. It was well accepted by coordinating nurses and performed well in predicting emergency hospitalizations. However, its use by NAs was less than expected. Overall, the system performed well in terms of performance and clinical impact in this setting. Nevertheless, further work is needed to improve the moderate use rate by NAs. ©Jacques-Henri Veyron, François Deparis, Marie Noel Al Zayat, Joël Belmin, Charlotte Havreng-Théry.},

   abstract = {Background: Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and although pancreatectomy is currently the only curative treatment, it is associated with significant morbidity. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of wearable telemonitoring technologies to predict treatment outcomes using patient activity metrics and machine learning. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, single-cohort study, patients scheduled for pancreatectomy were provided with a wearable telemonitoring device to be worn prior to surgery. Patient clinical data were collected and all patients were evaluated using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program surgical risk calculator (ACS-NSQIP SRC). Machine learning models were developed to predict whether patients would have a textbook outcome and compared with the ACS-NSQIP SRC using area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. Results: Between February 2019 and February 2020, 48 patients completed the study. Patient activity metrics were collected over an average of 27.8 days before surgery. Patients took an average of 4162.1 (SD 4052.6) steps per day and had an average heart rate of 75.6 (SD 14.8) beats per minute. Twenty-eight (58%) patients had a textbook outcome after pancreatectomy. The group of 20 (42%) patients who did not have a textbook outcome included 14 patients with severe complications and 11 patients requiring readmission. The ACS-NSQIP SRC had an AUROC curve of 0.6333 to predict failure to achieve a textbook outcome, while our model combining patient clinical characteristics and patient activity data achieved the highest performance with an AUROC curve of 0.7875. Conclusions: Machine learning models outperformed ACS-NSQIP SRC estimates in predicting textbook outcomes after pancreatectomy. The highest performance was observed when machine learning models incorporated patient clinical characteristics and activity metrics. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The capacity to predict complications and early intervention can improve postoperative outcomes. In this proof-of-concept study, we used a machine learning approach to explore the potential added value of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and patient-generated health data (PGHD) in predicting post-discharge complications for gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancer surgery patients. Methods: We formulated post-discharge complication prediction as a binary classification task. Features were extracted from clinical variables, PROs (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]), and PGHD (VivoFit) from a cohort of 52 patients with 134 temporal observation points pre- and post-discharge that were collected from two pilot studies. We trained and evaluated supervised learning classifiers via nested cross-validation. Results: A logistic regression model with L2 regularization trained with clinical data, PROs and PGHD from wearable pedometers achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.74. Conclusions: PROs and PGHDs captured through remote patient telemonitoring approaches have the potential to improve prediction performance for postoperative complications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for the development of low cardiac output and other physiologic derangements, which could be detected early through continuous stroke volume (SV) measurement. Unfortunately, existing SV measurement methods are limited in the clinic because of their invasiveness (eg, thermodilution), location (eg, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging), or unreliability (eg, bioimpedance). Multimodal wearable sensing, leveraging the seismocardiogram, a sternal vibration signal associated with cardiomechanical activity, offers a means to monitoring SV conveniently, affordably, and continuously. However, it has not been evaluated in a population with significant anatomical and physiological differences (ie, children with CHD) or compared against a true gold standard (ie, cardiac magnetic resonance). Here, we present the feasibility of wearable estimation of SV in a diverse CHD population (N=45 patients). METHODS AND RESULTS: We used our chest-worn wearable biosensor to measure baseline ECG and seismocardiogram signals from patients with CHD before and after their routine cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and derived features from the measured signals, predominantly systolic time intervals, to estimate SV using ridge regression. Wearable signal features achieved acceptable SV estimation (28% error with respect to cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging) in a held-out test set, per cardiac output measurement guidelines, with a root-mean-square error of 11.48 mL and R2 of 0.76. Additionally, we observed that using a combination of electrical and cardiomechanical features surpassed the performance of either modality alone. CONCLUSIONS: A convenient wearable biosensor that estimates SV enables remote monitoring of cardiac function and may potentially help identify decompensation in patients with CHD. © 2022 The Authors.},

   abstract = {Flexible and stretchable strain sensors have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in various fields including human health monitoring and human-machine interfaces. Previous studies have shown that strain sensors based on microcracks can exhibit both high sensitivity and a wide sensing range by manipulating the opening and closing of randomly generated cracks within conductive thin films. However, the uncontrolled nature of microcrack formation can cause a drift in the sensor's performance over time, affecting its accuracy and reliability. In this study, by pre-defining the cracks, we introduce a novel resistive strain sensor with high sensitivity, excellent linearity, an ultra-low detection limit, and robustness against off-axis deformation. The sensor operates on a simple mechanism involving the modulation of ohmic contact within intricately designed conductive serpentine curves, which are encapsulated by pre-stretched thin films. This design facilitates a high gauge factor of 495, exceptional linearity (R2 > 0.98), and an ultra-low detection threshold of 0.01% strain. Moreover, it maintains performance integrity during off-axis deformations such as bending and twisting, features that are indispensable for accurately monitoring human motion. To explore practical applications, a driving scenario was simulated where a sensor array was positioned on the driver's neck. The sensor output was analyzed using machine learning algorithms to successfully determine the presence of driver fatigue. This demonstration underlines the potential of our sensor technology in applications ranging from healthcare monitoring to wearable biomechanical systems and human-machine interfaces. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

To address this need, wearable sensor technology plays a crucial role in designing effective healthcare systems for the elderly, facilitating human–machine interaction. However, wearable technology has not been implemented accurately in monitoring various vital healthcare parameters of elders because of inaccurate monitoring. In addition, healthcare providers encounter issues regarding the acceptability of healthcare parameter monitoring and secure data communication within the context of elderly care in smart home environments. Therefore, this research is dedicated to investigating the accuracy of wearable sensors in monitoring healthcare parameters and ensuring secure data transmission. An architectural framework is introduced, outlining the critical components of a comprehensive system, including Sensing, Data storage, and Data communication (SDD) for the monitoring process. These vital components highlight the system's functionality and introduce elements for monitoring and tracking various healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. The collected data is subsequently communicated to healthcare providers to enhance the well-being of elderly individuals. The SDD taxonomy guides the implementation of wearable sensor technology through environmental and body sensors. The proposed system demonstrates the accuracy enhancement of healthcare parameter monitoring and tracking through smart sensors. This study evaluates state-of-the-art articles on monitoring and tracking healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of delineating the SSD taxonomy by classifying the system's major components, contributing to the analysis and resolution of existing challenges.

HAR systems have sapped great interest over the period of time due to its wide applications in the field of healthcare, surveillance and also in the coming generation of metaverse. This article proposes an artificial intelligence (AI) based system using hybrid deep learning model to recognise various human activities from the video footages. The deep convolutional layers and recurrent neural network (RNN) have been combined to generate the hybrid deep learning model known as convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN). The deep convolutional layers of deep convolutional neural network Inception V3 Net have been used to extract the feature values from the video frames corresponding to each human activity and each generated feature vector has been classified to the appropriate activity class by the gated recurrent unit (GRU) variant of RNN classifier. The performance of the proposed HAR system has been evaluated on the three widely used public datasets—KTH, UCF101, and UCF sports action dataset. GRU variant of RNN classifier is capable to store and remember a long temporal sequence of video frames, generating the pattern of any human activity, over a long duration and so experimental results exhibit that the proposed hybrid deep learning based HAR system outperforms the state-of-the-art methods available in this research domain. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.},

   abstract = {Various Human Activities are classified through time-series data generated by the sensors of wearable devices. Many real-time scenarios such as Healthcare Surveillance, Smart Cities and Intelligent surveillance etc. are based upon Human Activity Recognition. Despite the popularity of local features-based approaches and machine learning approaches, it fails to capture adequate temporal information. In this paper, the deep convolutional neural model has been proposed by combining external features, i.e. orientation invariant (||v||) and consecutive point trajectory information (||Δ v||) with tri-axis data of the accelerometer. The proposed external features based approach experimented on three different deep learning architecture, namely Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Convolution Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM). Accuracy of the algorithms radically improve with the additional input feature ||v|| and ||Δ v|| along with tri-axis data of accelerometer. The results show that the performance of all three LSTM, CNN and ConvLSTM models is better to compare with the state of art methods on WISDOM dataset and Activity dataset also the performance of ConvLSTM is 98.41% for WISDOM dataset and 98.04 for activity dataset, which is higher than that of CNN and LSTM model used in this paper. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {In recent years, AI(Artificial Intelligence) has achieved great development in modern society. More and more modern technologies are applied in surveillance and monitoring. Healthcare monitoring is growing ubiquitous in modern wearable devices, such as a smart watch, electrocardiogram (ECG) necklace, smart band. Many sensors are attached to these smart devices to record and monitor physiological signals caused by activities, and then propagated those recorded electrical data to be further processed to give health diagnosis, disease prevention or making a distress call automatically. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a sleep disorder with a high occurrence in adult people and observed as an autonomous risk factor for circulatory problems such as ischemic heart attacks and stroke. Numerous traditional neural network based methods have been developed to detect OSA, where these methods however could not provide the intended result because they rely on shallow network. In this paper, we propose an effective OSA detection based on Convolutional neural network. Our method first extracts features from Apnea-Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings using RR-intervals (time interval from one R-wave to the next R-wave in an ECG signal) and then CNN model having three convolution layers and three fully connected layers is trained with extracted features and applied for OSA detection. The first two convolution layers are followed by batch normalization and pooling layer, and softmax is connected to the last fully connected layer to give final decision. Experimental results on extracted feature of Apnea-ECG signal reveal that our model have better results in terms of performance measure sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It is expected that the related technology can be applied into smart sensors, especially wearable devices. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

In this study, we designed a robust and intelligent IoMT system through the synergistic integration of flexible wearable triboelectric sensors and deep learning-assisted data analytics. We embedded four triboelectric sensors into a wristband to detect and analyze limb movements in patients suffering from Parkinson's Disease (PD). By further integrating deep learning-assisted data analytics, we actualized an intelligent healthcare monitoring system for the surveillance and interaction of PD patients, which includes location/trajectory tracking, heart monitoring and identity recognition. This innovative approach enabled us to accurately capture and scrutinize the subtle movements and fine motor of PD patients, thus providing insightful feedback and comprehensive assessment of the patients’ conditions. This monitoring system is cost-effective, easily fabricated, highly sensitive, and intelligent, consequently underscores the immense potential of human body sensing technology in a Health 4.0 society. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We demonstrate that the modified composite hydrogel with low contact impedance and reduced adhesion provides high-quality long-term monitoring of local muscle electrical signals. We show that the integrated triaxial broad-band accelerometer also measures large body movements and subtle physiological activities/vibrations. We find that the combined data processed by a 2D-like sequential feature extractor with fully connected neurons facilitates the classification of various motion/speech features at a high accuracy of over 90%, which adapts to the data with noise from motion artifacts or the data from new human subjects.

   abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

   abstract = {Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by several motor symptoms that develop gradually: tremor, bradykinesia, limb rigidity, and gait and balance problems. While there is no cure, levodopa therapy has been shown to mitigate symptoms. A patient on levodopa experiences cycles in the severity of their symptoms, characterized by an ON state—when the drug is active—and an OFF state—when symptoms worsen as the drug wears off. The longitudinal progression of the disease is monitored using episodic assessments performed by trained physicians in the clinic, such as the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Lately, there has been an effort in the field to develop continuous, objective measures of motor symptoms based on wearable sensors and other remote monitoring devices. In this work, we present an effort towards such a solution that uses a single wearable inertial sensor to automatically assess the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) of a Parkinson’s disease patient. Sensor data was collected from two independent studies of subjects performing the UPDRS test and then used to train and validate a convolutional neural network model. Given the typical limited size of such studies we also employed the use of generative adversarial networks to improve the performance of deep-learning models that usually require larger amounts of data for training. We show that for a 2-min walk test, our method’s predicted PIGD scores can be used to identify a patient’s ON/OFF states better than a physician evaluated on the same criteria. This result paves the way for more reliable, continuous tracking of Parkinson’s disease symptoms. © 2022, The Author(s).},

Early diagnosis and treatment of SCC are essential to improve outcomes. Here we report a deep learning model-derived SCC-Score to detect and predict SCC from time-series data recorded continuously by a medical wearable. In this single-arm, single-center, observational cohort study, vital signs and physical activity were recorded with a wearable for 31,234 h in 79 patients (54 Inpatient Cohort (IC)/25 Outpatient Cohort (OC)). Hours with normal physical functioning without evidence of SCC (regular hours) were presented to a deep neural network that was trained by a self-supervised contrastive learning objective to extract features from the time series that are typical in regular periods. The model was used to calculate a SCC-Score that measures the dissimilarity to regular features. Detection and prediction performance of the SCC-Score was compared to clinical documentation of SCC (AUROC ± SD). In total 124 clinically documented SCC occurred in the IC, 16 in the OC. Detection of SCC was achieved in the IC with a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 87.9%, with AUROC of 0.91 ± 0.01 (OC sensitivity 77.4%, specificity 81.8%, AUROC 0.87 ± 0.02). Prediction of infectious SCC was possible up to 2 days before clinical diagnosis (AUROC 0.90 at −24 h and 0.88 at −48 h). We provide proof of principle for the detection and prediction of SCC in patients treated for hematological malignancies using wearable data and a deep learning model.

In the setting of limited healthcare resources, outpatient management of individuals newly diagnosed with COVID-19 was commonly implemented, some taking advantage of various personal health technologies, but only rarely using a multi-parameter chest-patch for continuous monitoring. Here we describe the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation index (CDI) model based on chest patch-derived continuous sensor data to predict COVID-19 hospitalizations in outpatient-managed COVID-19 positive individuals, achieving an overall AUC of the ROC Curve of 0.84 on 308 event negative participants, and 22 event positive participants, out of an overall study cohort of 400 participants. We retrospectively compare the performance of CDI to standard of care modalities, finding that the machine learning model outperforms the standard of care modalities in terms of both numbers of events identified and with a lower false alarm rate.

Data-driven models of human metabolism would constitute a reliable, fast, and continuously updating model for predictive analytics. Wearable devices, such as smart bands and impedance balances, allow the real time and remote monitoring of physiological parameters, providing for a flux of data carrying information on user metabolism. Here, we developed a data-driven model of end-user metabolism, the Personalized Metabolic Avatar (PMA), to estimate its personalized reactions to diets. PMA consists of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) deep learning model trained to forecast personalized weight variations according to macronutrient composition and daily energy balance. The model can perform simulations and evaluation of diet plans, allowing the definition of tailored goals for achieving ideal weight. This approach can provide the correct clues to empower citizens with scientific knowledge, augmenting their self-awareness with the aim to achieve long-lasting results in pursuing a healthy lifestyle. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, social isolation and quarantine have become commonplace across the world. IoT health monitoring solutions eliminate the need for regular doctor visits and interactions among patients and medical personnel. Many patients in wards or intensive care units require continuous monitoring of their health. Continuous patient monitoring is a hectic practice in hospitals with limited staff; in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, it becomes much more difficult practice when hospitals are working at full capacity and there is still a risk of medical workers being infected. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based patient health monitoring system that collects real-time data on important health indicators such as pulse rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature but can be expanded to include more parameters. Our system is comprised of a hardware component that collects and transmits data from sensors to a cloud-based storage system, where it can be accessed and analyzed by healthcare specialists. The ESP-32 microcontroller interfaces with the multiple sensors and wirelessly transmits the collected data to the cloud storage system. A pulse oximeter is utilized in our system to measure blood oxygen saturation and body temperature, as well as a heart rate monitor to measure pulse rate. A web-based interface is also implemented, allowing healthcare practitioners to access and visualize the collected data in real-time, making remote patient monitoring easier. Overall, our IoT-based patient health monitoring system represents a significant advancement in remote patient monitoring, allowing healthcare practitioners to access real-time data on important health metrics and detect potential health issues before they escalate.},

   abstract = {The IoT (Internet of Things) has played a promising role in e-healthcare applications during the last decade. Medical sensors record a variety of data and transmit them over the IoT network to facilitate remote patient monitoring. When a patient visits a hospital he may need to connect or disconnect medical devices from the medical healthcare system frequently. Also, multiple entities (e.g., doctors, medical staff, etc.) need access to patient data and require distinct sets of patient data. As a result of the dynamic nature of medical devices, medical users require frequent access to data, which raises complex security concerns. Granting access to a whole set of data creates privacy issues. Also, each of these medical user need to grant access rights to a specific set of medical data, which is quite a tedious task. In order to provide role-based access to medical users, this study proposes a blockchain-based framework for authenticating multiple entities based on the trust domain to reduce the administrative burden. This study is further validated by simulation on the infura blockchain using solidity and Python. The results demonstrate that role-based authorization and multi-entities authentication have been implemented and the owner of medical data can control access rights at any time and grant medical users easy access to a set of data in a healthcare system. The system has minimal latency compared to existing blockchain systems that lack multi-entity authentication and role-based authorization. © 2024 Aslam et al.

Despite the various studies found in the literature, some elements are still not well addressed, such as the study cohort, the experimental protocol, the type of research design, as well as the relevant features in this context. To this end, the objective of this pilot study was to investigate the efficacy of data-driven systems to characterize older individuals over 80 years of age with impaired physical function, during their daily routine and under unsupervised conditions. We propose a fully automated process which extracts a set of heterogeneous time-domain features from 24-hour files of acceleration and barometric data. After being statistically tested, the most discriminant features fed a group of machine learning classifiers to distinguish frail from non-frail subjects, achieving an accuracy up to 93.51%. Our analysis, conducted over 570 days of recordings, shows that a longitudinal study is important while using the proposed features, in order to ensure a highly specific diagnosis.

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The widespread adoption of wearables, for example, smartphones and smartwatches in the daily lives of the general population, allows passive monitoring of physiological and behavioural data in the real world. This qualitative study explores the perspective of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients towards these so-called digital biomarkers (dBMs). METHODS: As part of a Design Thinking approach, six focus groups were conducted involving 27 PsA patients. The semistructured topic guide included disease activity, coping strategies, care needs, and potential advantages and disadvantages of dBMs. Thematic analysis followed an abductive coding method. RESULTS: PsA daily permeates patients' lives, both physically and mentally. Participants discussed how their lives are focused on minimising the impact of the disease on their daily routines. Their attempts to gain control over their disease highly depend on trial and error. Flare-ups are related to physiological as well as behavioural micro and macro changes. Understanding these changes could enable the detection of (early) flare. Participants elicited pros and cons of the use of dBMs, discussed their intended use and made practical remarks. This led to three main themes: 'Perceived dBM opportunities', 'Mapping Disease activity' and 'Perceived dBM barriers and pitfalls'. CONCLUSION: PsA patients are receptive to dBMs for tracking the disease symptoms. Disease activity is regarded multifaceted and thus, dBMs should include a broad range of features to truly reflect the disease activity status. Reducing the time of trial and error in learning to manage the disease is regarded beneficial. Establishing and maintaining the relationship with their attending physicians is a prerequisite, even if remote patient monitoring becomes an alternative for some physical hospital visits. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

collected up to the time of discharge including demographics,
comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to

RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and
lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches
(random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main
outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of
discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission
significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient

However, current wearable electronics made from materials like conductive elastomers, hydrogels, and liquid metals face limitations, including low permeability, poor adhesion, inadequate conductivity, and limited stretchability. These issues hinder their effectiveness in long-term healthcare monitoring and exercise monitoring. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel design of web-droplet-like electronics featuring a semi-liquid metal coating for wearable applications. This innovative design offers high permeability, excellent stretchability, strong adhesion, and good conductivity for the electronic skin. The unique structure, inspired by the architecture of a spider web, significantly enhances air permeability compared to commercial breathable patches. Furthermore, the distribution of polyborosiloxane mimics the adhesive properties of spider web mucus, while the use of semi-liquid metals in this design results in remarkable conductivity (9 × 106 S/m) and tensile performance (up to 850% strain). This advanced electronic skin technology enables long-term monitoring of various physiological parameters and supports machine learning recognition functions with unparalleled advantages.

The work tackles important RPM concerns such early health issue diagnosis and accurate real-time physiological data collection and analysis using wearable IoT devices. By assessing important health factors like heart rate, blood pressure, pulse, temperature, activity level, weight management, respiration rate, medication adherence, sleep patterns, and oxygen levels, the suggested Remote Patient Monitor Model (RPMM) attains a noteworthy accuracy of 97.23%. The model's capacity to identify spatial and temporal relationships in health data is improved by novel techniques such as the use of CNN for spatial analysis and feature extraction and LSTM for temporal sequence modeling. Early intervention is made easier by this synergistic approach, which enhances trend identification and anomaly detection in vital signs. A variety of datasets are used to validate the model's robustness, highlighting its efficacy in remote patient care.

Thirty-six BC patients were invited to wear FT during their RT course for continuous monitoring of heart rate (HR) and step counts (STP). RIF assessment was performed weekly, according to CTCAE v5.0 and dichotomized into G0 vs. any-grade. A novel concept based on patient Repeated Activity Window (RAW) was introduced to evaluate HR and STP variations during RT. Several Machine Learning (ML) methods were trained to characterize RIF on the basis of HR and STP collected data. RIF of any grade was reported by 17 out of 36 patients (47%) included in the study. None of patient clinical variables were significantly correlated with RIF. All patients accepted the FT monitoring program, and for 32 patients FT collection efficiency was greater than 60%. For each patient, a distinct distribution of RAWs was identifiable over RT and across the entire patient cohort, with a total of 7950 RAWs processed. Six features related to RAWs, HR and STP were identified as associated with RIF. The best-performing classifier was the Bagged Trees model, showing a cross-validated ROC-AUC of 89% (95% CI 88–90%). This study confirms the feasibility of continuous biomedical monitoring of BC patients by FT. We successfully identify objective indicators of RIF through HR and STP variation measures within each patient’s RAW, thus providing a novel and practical approach to assess and manage RIF. This can significantly aid medical staff in evaluating RIF trajectories, potentially leading to better individualized care strategies and improved patient outcomes. © The Author(s) 2024.},

The mean National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) were 0.59 ± 0.7. 1231 manual measurement of physiology parameters were performed during hospital stay (median 15 days). Physiology parameters obtained from wearable biosensors correlated well with manual measurement including pulse rate (r = 0.96, p < 0.0001) and oxygen saturation (r = 0.87, p < 0.0001). A machine learning-derived index reflecting overall health status, Biovitals Index (BI), was generated by autonomous analysis of physiology parameters, symptoms, and other medical data. Daily BI was linearly associated with respiratory tract viral load (p < 0.0001) and NEWS2 (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). BI was superior to NEWS2 in predicting clinical worsening events (sensitivity 94.1% and specificity 88.9%) and prolonged hospitalization (sensitivity 66.7% and specificity 72.7%).

   abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) technology enables continuous behavior monitoring, which is particularly valuable in healthcare. This study investigates the viability of using an ear-worn motion sensor for classifying daily activities, including lying, sitting/standing, walking, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and running. Fifty healthy participants (between 20 and 47 years old) engaged in these activities while under monitoring. Various machine learning algorithms, ranging from interpretable shallow models to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches designed for HAR (i.e., DeepConvLSTM and ConvTransformer), were employed for classification. The results demonstrate the ear sensor’s efficacy, with deep learning models achieving a 98% accuracy rate of classification. The obtained classification models are agnostic regarding which ear the sensor is worn and robust against moderate variations in sensor orientation (e.g., due to differences in auricle anatomy), meaning no initial calibration of the sensor orientation is required. The study underscores the ear’s efficacy as a suitable site for monitoring human daily activity and suggests its potential for combining HAR with in-ear vital sign monitoring. This approach offers a practical method for comprehensive health monitoring by integrating sensors in a single anatomical location. This integration facilitates individualized health assessments, with potential applications in tele-monitoring, personalized health insights, and optimizing athletic training regimes. © 2024 by the authors.},

This study explores the use of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for activity recognition in a mock condo in the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital. UWB systems with built-in Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors were tested, using anchors set up across the condo and a tag worn by patients. We tested various UWB setups, changed the number of anchors, and varied the tag placement (on the wrist or chest). Wrist-worn tags consistently outperformed chest-worn tags, and the nine-anchor configuration yielded the highest accuracy. Machine learning models were developed to classify activities based on UWB and IMU data. Models that included positional data significantly outperformed those that did not. The Random Forest model with a 4 s data window achieved an accuracy of 94%, compared to 79.2% when positional data were excluded. These findings demonstrate that incorporating positional data with IMU sensors is a promising method for effective remote patient monitoring. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, since there is a discrepancy between wrist and actual forehead temperature, this study incorporates statistical methods and machine learning to estimate the core forehead temperature from the wrist. This research collects 2130 samples from 30 volunteers, and both the statistical least squares method and machine learning via linear regression are applied to analyze these data. It is observed that all models achieve a significant fit, but the third-degree polynomial model stands out in both approaches.

This study aims to investigate the use of wearable-sensor-derived physical activity data and machine learning to objectively identify physical-aggressive incidents in children. Participants (n = 39) aged 7 to 16 years, with and without ADHD, wore a waist-worn activity monitor (ActiGraph, GT3X+) for up to one week, three times over 12 months, while demographic, anthropometric, and clinical data were collected. Machine learning techniques, specifically random forest, were used to analyze patterns that identify physical-aggressive incident with 1-min time resolution. A total of 119 aggression episodes, lasting 7.3 ± 13.1 min for a total of 872 1-min epochs including 132 physical aggression epochs, were collected. The model achieved high precision (80.2%), accuracy (82.0%), recall (85.0%), F1 score (82.4%), and area under the curve (89.3%) to distinguish physical aggression epochs. The sensor-derived feature of vector magnitude (faster triaxial acceleration) was the second contributing feature in the model, and significantly distinguished aggression and non-aggression epochs. If validated in larger samples, this model could provide a practical and efficient solution for remotely detecting and managing aggressive incidents in children. © 2023 by the authors.},

Upper limb recovery requires high repetitions of task-specific practice. Stroke survivors are often prescribed task practices at home to supplement rehabilitation therapy. A poor quality of task practices, such as the use of compensatory movement patterns, results in maladaptive neuroplasticity and suboptimal motor recovery. There currently lacks a tool for the remote monitoring of movement quality of stroke survivors’ task practices at home. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of classifying movement quality at home using a wearable IMU. Nineteen stroke survivors wore an IMU sensor on the paretic wrist and performed four functional upper limb tasks in the lab and later at home while videorecording themselves. The lab data served as reference data to classify home movement quality using dynamic time warping. Incorrect and correct movement quality was labeled by a therapist. The home task practice movement quality was classified with an accuracy of 92% and F1 score of 0.95 for all tasks combined. Movement types contributing to misclassification were further investigated. The results support the feasibility of a home movement quality monitoring system to assist with upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Ubiquitous computing has been a green research area that has managed to attract and sustain the attention of researchers for some time now. As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel. For the evaluation and testing of the proposed system, two openly accessible benchmark datasets, the ExtraSensory dataset and the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, were used. The system outperformed the available state-of-the-art systems by recognizing human activities with an accuracy of 88.25% and classifying the location with an accuracy of 90.63% over the ExtraSensory dataset, while, for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, the respective results were 96.00% and 90.50% accurate. © 2023 by the authors.},

They provide the flexibility of monitoring elders remotely for their families and caregivers. Activities of daily living are an efficient way to effectively monitor elderly people at home and patients at caregiving facilities. The monitoring of such actions depends largely on IoT-based devices, either wireless or installed at different places. This paper proposes an effective and robust layered architecture using multisensory devices to recognize the activities of daily living from anywhere. Multimodality refers to the sensory devices of multiple types working together to achieve the objective of remote monitoring. Therefore, the proposed multimodal-based approach includes IoT devices, such as wearable inertial sensors and videos recorded during daily routines, fused together. The data from these multi-sensors have to be processed through a pre-processing layer through different stages, such as data filtration, segmentation, landmark detection, and 2D stick model. In next layer called the features processing, we have extracted, fused, and optimized different features from multimodal sensors. The final layer, called classification, has been utilized to recognize the activities of daily living via a deep learning technique known as convolutional neural network. It is observed from the proposed IoT-based multimodal layered system’s results that an acceptable mean accuracy rate of 84.14% has been achieved. © 2023 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The use of wearable sensors allows continuous recordings of physical activity from participants in free-living or at-home clinical studies. The large amount of data collected demands automatic analysis pipelines to extract gait parameters that can be used as clinical endpoints. We introduce a deep learning-based automatic pipeline for wearables that processes tri-axial accelerometry data and extracts gait events—bout segmentation, initial contact (IC), and final contact (FC)—from a single sensor located at either the lower back (near L5), shin or wrist. The gait events detected are posteriorly used for gait parameter estimation, such as step time, length, and symmetry. We report results from a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) validation on a pilot study dataset of five participants clinically diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and six healthy controls (HC). Participants wore sensors at three body locations and walked on a pressure-sensing walkway to obtain reference gait data. Mean absolute errors (MAE) for the IC events ranged from 22.82 to 33.09 milliseconds (msecs) for the lower back sensor while for the shin and wrist sensors, MAE ranges were 28.56–64.66 and 40.19–72.50 msecs, respectively. For the FC-event detection, MAE ranges were 29.06–48.42, 40.19–72.70 and 36.06–60.18 msecs for the lumbar, wrist and shin sensors, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients, ICC(2,k), between the estimated parameters and the reference data resulted in good-to-excellent agreement (ICC ≥ 0.84) for the lumbar and shin sensors, excluding the double support time (ICC = 0.37 lumbar and 0.38 shin) and swing time (ICC = 0.55 lumbar and 0.59 shin). The wrist sensor also showed good agreements, but the ICCs were lower overall than for the other two sensors. Our proposed analysis pipeline has the potential to extract up to 100 gait-related parameters, and we expect our contribution will further support developments in the fields of wearable sensors, digital health, and remote monitoring in clinical trials. © 2021 by the authors.

   abstract = {Smart sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled remote automated monitoring (RAMs), can free a nurse from the task of in-person patient monitoring during the transportation process of patients between different wards in hospital settings. Automation of hospital beds using advanced robotics and sensors has been a growing trend exacerbated by the COVID crisis. In this exploratory study, a polynomial regression (PR) machine learning (ML) RAM algorithm based on a Dreyfusian descriptor for immediate wellbeing monitoring was proposed for the autonomous hospital bed transport (AHBT) application. This method was preferred over several other AI algorithm for its simplicity and quick computation. The algorithm quantified historical data using supervised photoplethysmography (PPG) data for 5 min just before the start of the autonomous journey, referred as pre-journey (PJ) dataset. During the transport process, the algorithm continued to quantify immediate measurements using non-overlapping sets of 30 PPG waveforms, referred as in-journey (IJ) dataset. In combination, this algorithm provided a binary decision condition that determined if AHBT should continue its journey to destination by checking the degree of polynomial (DoP) between PJ and IJ. Wrist PPG was used as algorithm’s monitoring parameter. PPG data was collected simultaneously from both wrists of 35 subjects, aged 21 and above in postures mimicking that in AHBT and were given full freedom of upper limb and wrist movement. It was observed that the top goodness-of-fit which indicated potentials for high data accountability had 0.2 to 0.6 cross validation score mean (CVSM) occurring at 8th to 10th DoP for PJ datasets and 0.967 to 0.994 CVSM at 9th to 10th DoP for IJ datasets. CVSM was a reliable metric to pick out the best PJ and IJ DoPs. Central tendency analysis showed that coinciding DoP distributions between PJ and IJ datasets, peaking at 8th DoP, was the precursor to high algorithm stability. Mean algorithm efficacy was 0.20 as our proposed algorithm was able to pick out all signals from a conscious subject having full freedom of movement. This efficacy was acceptable as a first ML proof of concept for AHBT. There was no observable difference between subjects’ left and right wrists. © 2021 by the authors.

Current gait analysis methods, such as wearables or cameras, have privacy and operational constraints, especially when used with older adults. Millimeter-Wave (MMW) radar is a promising solution for gait applications because of its low-cost, better privacy, and resilience to ambient light and climate conditions. This paper presents a novel human gait analysis method that combines the micro-Doppler spectrogram and skeletal pose estimation using MMW radar for HAR. In our approach, we used the Texas Instruments IWR6843ISK-ODS MMW radar to obtain the micro-Doppler spectrogram and point clouds for 19 human joints. We developed a multilayer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize and classify five different gait patterns with an accuracy of 95.7 to 98.8% using MMW radar data. During training of the CNN algorithm, we used the extracted 3D coordinates of 25 joints using the Kinect V2 sensor and compared them with the point clouds data to improve the estimation. Finally, we performed a real-time simulation to observe the point cloud behavior for different activities and validated our system against the ground truth values. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to distinguish between different human activities to obtain clinically relevant gait information. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The application of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques in the medical world is growing, with a range of purposes: from the identification and prediction of possible diseases to patient monitoring and clinical decision support systems. Furthermore, the widespread use of remote monitoring medical devices, under the umbrella of the “Internet of Medical Things” (IoMT), has simplified the retrieval of patient information as they allow continuous monitoring and direct access to data by healthcare providers. However, due to possible issues in real-world settings, such as loss of connectivity, irregular use, misuse, or poor adherence to a monitoring program, the data collected might not be sufficient to implement accurate algorithms. For this reason, data augmentation techniques can be used to create synthetic datasets sufficiently large to train machine learning models. In this work, we apply the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to perform a data augmentation from patient data obtained through IoMT sensors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) monitoring. We also apply an explainable AI algorithm to demonstrate the accuracy of the synthetic data by comparing it to the real data recorded by the sensors. The results obtained demonstrate how synthetic datasets created through a well-structured GAN are comparable with a real dataset, as validated by a novel approach based on machine learning. © 2021 by the authors.

Taking the Fried frailty criteria as a reference to determine physical frailty and frailty phenotypes (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, inactivity), this study aimed to explore the benefit of machine learning to determine the least number of digital biomarkers of physical frailty measurable from a pendant sensor during activities of daily living. Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults were classified into robust or pre-frail/frail groups based on the physical frailty assessments by the Fried frailty criteria. All participants wore a pendant sensor at the sternum level for 48 h. Of seventeen sensor-derived features extracted from a pendant sensor, fourteen significant features were used for machine learning based on logistic regression modeling and a recursive feature elimination technique incorporating bootstrapping. The combination of percentage time standing, percentage time walking, walking cadence, and longest walking bout were identified as optimal digital biomarkers of physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. These findings suggest that a combination of sensor-measured exhaustion, inactivity, and speed have potential to screen and monitor people for physical frailty and frailty phenotypes. © 2021 by the authors.

For the analysis of medical scans, various studies integrate sophisticated deep learning strategies. A smart monitoring system is needed as a proactive diagnostic solution that may be employed in an epidemiological scenario such as COVID-19. Consequently, this work offers an intelligent medicare system that is an IoT-empowered, deep learning-based decision support system (DSS) for the automated detection and categorization of infectious diseases (COVID-19 and pneumothorax). The proposed DSS system was evaluated using three independent standard-based chest X-ray scans. The suggested DSS predictor has been used to identify and classify areas on whole X-ray scans with abnormalities thought to be attributable to COVID-19, reaching an identification and classification accuracy rate of 89.58% for normal images and 89.13% for COVID-19 and pneumothorax. With the suggested DSS system, a judgment depending on individual chest X-ray scans may be made in approximately 0.01 s. As a result, the DSS system described in this study can forecast at a pace of 95 frames per second (FPS) for both models, which is near to real-time. © 2022 by the authors.},

This method is subject to human error and cannot provide continuous remote monitoring. Continuous monitoring using wearable sensors may provide a more comprehensive assessment of lower-limb muscular function. In this work, we propose an algorithm to classify stair climbing periods and estimate SCP from a lower-back worn accelerometer, which strongly agrees with the clinical standard (r = 0.92, p < 0.001; ICC = 0.90, [0.82, 0.94]). Data were collected in-lab from healthy adults (n = 65) performing the four-step SCPT and a walking assessment while instrumented (accelerometer + gyroscope), which allowed us to investigate tradeoffs between sensor modalities. Using two classifiers, we were able to identify periods of stair ascent with >89% accuracy [sensitivity = >0.89, specificity = >0.90] using two ensemble machine learning algorithms, trained on accelerometer signal features. Minimal changes in model performances were observed using the gyroscope alone (±0–6% accuracy) versus the accelerometer model. While we observed a slight increase in accuracy when combining gyroscope and accelerometer (about +3–6% accuracy), this is tolerable to preserve battery life in the at-home environment. This work is impactful as it shows potential for an accelerometer-based at-home assessment of SCP. © 2022 by the authors.},

Using an accelerometer and gyroscope on the chest yield mechanocardiographic (MCG) data. We investigated whether STEMI causes changes in MCG signals which could help to detect STEMI. The study group consisted of 41 STEMI patients and 49 control patients referred for elective coronary angiography and having normal left ventricular function and no valvular heart disease or arrhythmia. MCG signals were recorded on the upper sternum in supine position upon arrival to the catheterization laboratory. In this study, we used a dedicated wearable sensor equipped with 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis gyroscope and 1-lead ECG in order to facilitate the detection of STEMI in a clinically meaningful way. A supervised machine learning approach was used. Stability of beat morphology, signal strength, maximum amplitude and its timing were calculated in six axes from each window with varying band-pass filters in 2–90 Hz range. In total, 613 features were investigated. Using logistic regression classifier and leave-one-person-out cross validation we obtained a sensitivity of 73.9%, specificity of 85.7% and AUC of 0.857 (SD = 0.005) using 150 best features. As a result, mechanical signals recorded on the upper chest wall with the accelerometers and gyroscopes differ significantly between STEMI patients and stable patients with normal left ventricular function. Future research will show whether MCG can be used for the early screening of STEMI. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The Personal KinetiGraph™ (PKG) and similar wearable sensors have shown promise in enabling objective, continuous remote health monitoring for Parkinson’s patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose to use objective sensor data from the PKG and apply machine learning to cluster patients based on levodopa regimens and response. The resulting clusters are then used to enhance treatment planning by providing improved initial treatment estimates to supplement a physician’s initial assessment. We apply kmeans clustering to a dataset of within-subject Parkinson’s medication changes—clinically assessed by the MDS-Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale-III (MDS-UPDRS-III) and the PKG sensor for movement staging. A random forest classification model was then used to predict patients’ cluster allocation based on their respective demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data. Clinically relevant clusters were partitioned by levodopa dose, medication administration frequency, and total levodopa equivalent daily dose—with the PKG providing similar symptomatic assessments to physician MDS-UPDRS-III scores. A random forest classifier trained on demographic information, MDS-UPDRS-III scores, and PKG time-series data was able to accurately classify subjects of the two most demographically similar clusters with an accuracy of 86.9%, an F1 score of 90.7%, and an AUC of 0.871. A model that relied solely on demographic information and PKG time-series data provided the next best performance with an accuracy of 83.8%, an F1 score of 88.5%, and an AUC of 0.831, hence further enabling fully remote assessments. These computational methods demonstrate the feasibility of using sensor-based data to cluster patients based on their medication responses with further potential to assist with medication recommendations. © 2021 by the authors.

When these people live alone, it is convenient that a caregiver or family member visits them periodically. However, these visits do not prevent falls when the elderly person is alone. Furthermore, in exceptional circumstances, such as a pandemic, we must avoid unnecessary mobility. This is why remote monitoring systems are currently on the rise, and several commercial solutions can be found. However, current solutions use devices attached to the waist or wrist, causing discomfort in the people who wear them. The users also tend to forget to wear the devices carried in these positions. Therefore, in order to prevent these problems, the main objective of this work is designing and recollecting a new dataset about falls, falling risks and activities of daily living using an ankle-placed device obtaining a good balance between the different activity types. This dataset will be a useful tool for researchers who want to integrate the fall detector in the footwear. Thus, in this work we design the fall-detection device, study the suitable activities to be collected, collect the dataset from 21 users performing the studied activities and evaluate the quality of the collected dataset.

   abstract = {In healthcare, physical activity can be monitored in two ways: self‐monitoring by the patient himself or external monitoring by health professionals. Regarding self‐monitoring, wearable activity trackers allow automated passive data collection that educate and motivate patients. Wearing an activity tracker can improve walking time by around 1500 steps per day. However, there are concerns about measurement accuracy (e.g., lack of a common validation protocol or measurement discrepancies between different devices). For external monitoring, many innovative electronic tools are currently used in rheumatology to help support physician time management, to reduce the burden on clinic time, and to prioritize patients who may need further attention. In inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis, regular monitoring of patients to detect disease flares improves outcomes. In a pilot study applying machine learning to activity tracker steps, we showed that physical activity was strongly linked to disease flares and that patterns of physical activity could be used to predict flares with great accuracy, with a sensitivity and specificity above 95%. Thus, automatic monitoring of steps may lead to improved disease control through potential early identification of disease flares. However, activity trackers have some limitations when applied to rheumatic patients, such as tracker adherence, lack of clarity on long‐term effectiveness, or the potential multiplicity of trackers. © 2020 by the authors.

   abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are often characterized by their multifactorial complexity. This makes remote monitoring and ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation (CR) therapy challenging. Current wearable multimodal devices enable remote monitoring. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can help in tackling multifaceted datasets. However, for clinical acceptance, easy interpretability of the AI models is crucial. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether a multi-parameter sensor could be used during a standardized activity test to interpret functional capacity in the longitudinal follow-up of CR patients. A total of 129 patients were followed for 3 months during CR using 6-min walking tests (6MWT) equipped with a wearable ECG and accelerometer device. Functional capacity was assessed based on 6MWT distance (6MWD). Linear and nonlinear interpretable models were explored to predict 6MWD. The t-distributed stochastic neighboring embedding (t-SNE) technique was exploited to embed and visualize high dimensional data. The performance of support vector machine (SVM) models, combining different features and using different kernel types, to predict functional capacity was evaluated. The SVM model, using chronotropic response and effort as input features, showed a mean absolute error of 42.8 m (±36.8 m). The 3D-maps derived using the t-SNE technique visualized the relationship between sensor-derived biomarkers and functional capacity, which enables tracking of the evolution of patients throughout the CR program. The current study showed that wearable monitoring combined with interpretable ML can objectively track clinical progression in a CR population. These results pave the road towards ambulatory CR. © MDPI AG. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {With the advent of advanced materials processing techniques, and physical sensors’ output data acquisition, transmission and processing by embedded systems through internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, etc., tools are opened up many possibilities in distributed healthcare monitor, robotic process automation, smart home, etc., domains. To further augment the efficiency of these applications wearable sensors, electronic skin, smart sensors, etc., were fabricated with a variety of materials combination. Among many sensors, temperature, pressure and volume (plethysmo) sensors are widely used in healthcare to monitor vital signs: body temperature(BT), heart rate (HR), blood pressure(BP), respiration rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (Osat). These readings are called vital signs because they all must be present for life to continue. Vital signs measurement by wearable tactile/ pressure sensors for healthcare monitor are most widely researched in the recent years due to their promising application in a distributed healthcare system. Hence, it is important to understand both the basics of vital signs and their measurement by various transduction based tactile sensors in details to devise a suitable sensor for vital signs monitor. In the literature, there are many research articles on vital signs monitor by pressure sensors with qualitative data and, some times, exaggerated claims of measurements and suitability of a sensor for specific vital sign measurement. However, for real applications one need quantitative parameters of a sensor for a particular application. Thus it may worth to separate the wheat from the chaff by studying the fundamentals of vital signs, measurement requirements and limitations of measuring techniques etc., in details. This information is missing in the literature. Hence we have systematically presented the various electrical transduction based tactile or pressure sensor technologies, sensor fabrication methods, sensor characteristics modification, basics of vital signs, and measurement techniques. The past three years literature on respective vital sign measurement were also presented here. It is inferred that the tactile sensor should be highly sensitive in linear working range of 30–190 mmHg (4–25 kPa) to measure blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate. However, the required sensitivity value is not yet determined for each of the above measurements, in the literature. Both resistance and capacitance tactile sensors’ sensitivity and linear working range can be enhanced by employing biomimetic surface microstructures, 3D porous microstructures, intrafillable microstructures, metallic fillers, ionic liquids, etc., The details of each method is described in the article under suitable section. It is still a great challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, wide linear working range, excellent stability in a sensor for meeting the requirements of full-scale healthcare monitoring from subtle deformations (due to blood pulse, and cheek occlusion) to large deformations (due to finger bending and pressing). © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, digitization has opened up various possibilities in the healthcare sector. Smart healthcare is becoming a field of remarkable transformations and growth in the new era of smart cities and digitally interconnected societies. In smart healthcare systems, multiple sensors, devices, and sources are interconnected through networks and collect valuable data that gives insights about the patient's health status and ongoing health trends. Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is a concept that represents the identifiable sensors, devices, and sources connected to the internet and that can be utilized in various automated patient monitoring applications to provide remote healthcare services. This article aims to provide an IoHT driven deep learning-based system for non-invasive patient discomfort detection. The developed system comprises of an RGB camera device to identify discomfort in a patient's body instead of utilizing any wearable sensors or devices. In order to identify movement and discomfort, the system utilizes the YOLOv3 model to detect the patient's body and the Alphapose method to extract different keypoints information of the patient's body. Applying association rules, the detected keypoints are then converted into six central body organs. To detect a patient's discomfort, pairwise distance is measured between detected keypoints, and finally, time frame rules are applied to set a threshold in order to analyze movements as either associated with normal or discomfort conditions. The patient's body is monitored continuously for multiple frames, based on which comfort and discomfort levels are distinguished. Different video sequences are used for experimental evaluations; results reveal the effectiveness of the developed system by achieving a True Positive Rate of 95% with a 6% False Positive Rate. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The promise of remote patient monitoring (RPM) lies in its ability to revolutionize health care delivery by enabling continuous, real-time tracking of patient health outside traditional clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of RPM, particularly in underserved and rural populations, highlighting both its potential and the persistent barriers that limit its widespread use. This paper explores the critical role of technological advancements—such as wear-ables, artificial intelligence (AI), and broadband expansion—in sustaining and optimizing RPM in the postpandemic era. We examine Michigan as a microcosm of national health care challenges, focusing on its diverse population and geographic barriers, and propose condition-specific RPM protocols to address these inequities. Key facilitators and barriers to RPM implementation are discussed, with a focus on AI integration, community engagement, and digital infrastructure. We also explore the role of policy reform and public–private partnerships in supporting RPM’s scalability and long-term sustainability. Our findings suggest that while RPM offers a powerful tool for improving health care access and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions and rural maternal health, sustained investment in technology and infrastructure is critical. By addressing these challenges, RPM can become a cornerstone of modern health care, reducing disparities and improving care delivery for underserved populations. © MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC.},

   abstract = {Innovative research works in the healthcare sector keep on advancing every day. As the “Internet of Things (IoT)” keeps on evolving, the application of IoT in the medical field is prominent these days. Utilizing IoT devices, alert messages can be sent directly to medical professionals in case of an emergency. So, monitoring the health condition of an individual using IoT technology has become a popular and beneficial method in today's contemporary medical field. With the help of mobile IoT medical equipment, the technology of smart Healthcare Monitoring System (HMS) is proliferating. By utilizing deep learning and IoT technology, the medical diagnosis system has evolved from direct face-to-face visits to the hospital to remote telemedicine method. Most of the data generated by the IoT wearable sensors are highly correlated and may consist of outliers. The extraction of the essential attributes from these data is a complicated task. So, “deep learning and machine learning” techniques are adapted to determine the most relevant and appropriate feature required for efficient diagnosis from the unstructured data produced by the IoT devices and thus help in minimizing the redundancy of unnecessary data. Fusing deep learning methods with healthcare IoT made only the essential details to be available for diagnosis. Therefore, a deep learning-oriented IoT-based HMS is executed in this work. With the support of several wearable healthcare devices, the required data are acquired. The encryption of the data acquired from standard sources using Optimal Key-based Advanced Encryption Standard (OK-AES) is carried out next to assure the security of the sensitive medical data. The keys for AES encryption are optimally chosen with the aid of the Enhanced Heap-Based Optimizer Algorithm (EHBOA). The encrypted data is transferred to the “cloud platform” for data storage. Once there is a need for the data, then the encrypted data is initially downloaded from the cloud platform. Then using the same AES scheme, the decryption of the data to attain the original data is carried out. From the retrieved data, the extraction of the crucial attributes is carried out. The extracted features are chosen in an optimized manner and are concatenated with the tuned weights to form the weighted feature matrix. This formulated weighted feature matrix is provided as input to the “Adaptive Dilated Transformer Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (ADTBi-LSTM-GRU) model.” The variables in the ADTBG are optimized using the EHBOA for providing an accurate classification outcome. The classified disease outcome is obtained from the deployed ADTBi-LSTM-GRU model. Simulations are done to verify the efficiency and reliability of the implemented deep learning and IoT-based HMS. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

However, conventional machine learning approaches often encounter difficulties when dealing with IoT data due to its noise, heterogeneity, and high dimensions. In this study, we introduce a novel technique for developing human-centric intelligent systems for remote monitoring of chronic diseases using deep learning in an IoT context. This technique is capable of handling complex and diverse IoT data, providing accurate and comprehensible predictions and recommendations. We outline a standardized architecture for these systems, comprising of three distinct phases: data acquisition, data processing, and data visualization. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology, we apply it to a case study involving the development and evaluation of a human-centered intelligent system for remote monitoring of hypertension and diabetic patients, involving real users. Our findings reveal a substantial enhancement in prediction accuracy when employing our proposed hybrid algorithm. When compared to traditional algorithms, our proposed hybrid algorithm exhibits superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 93.5%, surpassing the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with an accuracy of 88.2%, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks at 90.4%, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at 91.6%. This improvement in accuracy is critical for ensuring reliable disease monitoring and management, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. In terms of precision, scalability, and user satisfaction, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. Furthermore, we address the social and ethical implications inherent in our methodology and suggest avenues for future research in this domain. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {Recently, a wide variety of real-world problems are solved via cloud computing, deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT). These methodologies are concerned with different areas like smart cities, agriculture, transportation systems, and healthcare systems. The existing researchers focused on the health care monitoring application along with IoT and cloud computing. It met several shortcomings in case of computational complexity, cost, time, and improper health care data storage and so forth. To overcome these challenges, the novel IoT-enabled secure healthcare monitoring model is proposed in this study. At first, several sensors are deployed in the human body thereby collecting patients' data with respect to vital parameters like body temperature deviation. The patient's health record dataset consists of 10 attributes namely phone numbers, marital status, address, age, name, heartbeat rate, oxygen level, smoking, temperature, and blood pressure. The data size reduction and normalization are performed in the IoT medical sensor dataset which contains the redundant or irrelevant attributes that are eliminated during pre-processing. The artificial hummingbird (AHB) algorithm-based convolutional neural network (AHB-CNN) model performs both feature extraction and classification of cancer disease. The AHB-CNN model classifies whether the patient is prone to cancer or not based on the sensor input collected. The received results are then sent to the hospital management for analysis. The Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) encryption method is mostly used in this study due to the major benefits it gives in terms of asymmetric encryption, ease of use, simpler deployment, and high security associated with factoring large prime numbers. A modified RSA algorithm is used in this article which uses the double encryption-decryption process and “n” prime numbers to enhance the security of the conventional RSA algorithm. The data is always encrypted during transit before being stored in the cloud or for further processing. Depending upon the experimental consequences, the proposed method established superior performances compared to other state-of-art techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
