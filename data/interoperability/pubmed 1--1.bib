  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Technological advances allow for recording and
               sharing health-related data in a patient-centric way using
               smartphones and wearables. Secure sharing of such
               patient-generated data with physicians would enable close
               management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk
               factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient
               monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully
               integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric
               design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to
               conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable,
               interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous
               feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable
               (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate
               factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. METHODS:
               The RPM system requirements were established through focus group
               sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and
               implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical
               feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility,
               the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective
               randomized interventional study focusing on dilated
               cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12
               months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability
               from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an
               evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction
               frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data
               classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and
               patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive
               statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear
               regression with 95\% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the
               influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group
               membership. RESULTS: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable
               components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a
               notification service. The system was evaluated with 95
               consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29\%
               female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study
               protocol. The system's app achieved a mean System Usability
               Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device
               experience. In total, 87\% (83/95) of the patients could
               integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily
               routine, and 71\% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for
               management of their health condition. On average, patients
               interacted with the wearable on 61\% (SD 26\%) of days enrolled
               in the study. SHD were available on average for 78\% (SD 23\%)
               of days, and PROM data were available on 64\% (SD 27\%) of weeks
               enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and
               PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group
               membership. CONCLUSIONS: Our results mark a first step toward
               integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for
               primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They
               can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable,
               interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into
               patients' daily routines.",
