  abstract={In this work, we propose and develop healthcare device interoperability (HeDI)—a system to enable device interoperability in IoT-enabled in-home healthcare monitoring platforms. The system consists of multiple sensors, each connected wirelessly to an edge device, acting as a wireless communication gateway to a remote server. The system initiates information handshaking between the sensor adapters and edge device at the beginning of the operation, which is later used to detect the sensor settings to process the data received from the sensor. The system is scalable and dynamically accommodates multiple sensors without any predefined ontologies at the edge device. The implementation of our system avoids dependencies on a system’s physical ports. The low form factor and wireless connectivity of the adapter make the system portable and convenient for in-home health monitoring. Additionally, the system allows multiple homogeneous sensors to operate at the same time in the same system. We implement and evaluate our system with a 3-lead ECG, pulse, and temperature sensors against two different network configurations—star and mesh. We use the data set generated from our implemented system for performance analysis. The network-level analysis of our system shows an average packet delivery ratio of 0.92 for star network configuration and 0.98 for mesh network configuration, ensuring the reliability of performance and its suitability for healthcare monitoring systems.},

  abstract={Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

  abstract={There is a global concern with the escalating number of patients at hospitals caused mainly by population aging, chronic diseases, and recently by the COVID-19 outbreak. To smooth this challenge, IoT emerges as an encouraging paradigm because it provides the scalability required for this purpose, supporting continuous and reliable health monitoring on a global scale. Based on this context, an IoT-based healthcare platform to provide remote monitoring for patients in a critical situation was proposed in the authors’ previous works. Therefore, this paper aims to extend the platform by integrating wearable and unobtrusive sensors to monitor patients with coronavirus disease. Furthermore, we report a real deployment of our approach in an intensive care unit for COVID-19 patients in Brazil.},

  abstract={This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.},

  abstract={Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.},

  abstract={Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume & performance, device diversity & interoperability, hacking & unauthorized use and acceptance & adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics.},
