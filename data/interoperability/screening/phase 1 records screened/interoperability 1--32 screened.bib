   abstract = {As COVID-19 hounds the world, the common cause of finding a swift solution to manage the pandemic has brought together researchers, institutions, governments, and society at large. The Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI)—including machine learning (ML) and Big Data analytics—as well as Robotics and Blockchain, are the four decisive areas of technological innovation that have been ingenuity harnessed to fight this pandemic and future ones. While these highly interrelated smart and connected health technologies cannot resolve the pandemic overnight and may not be the only answer to the crisis, they can provide greater insight into the disease and support frontline efforts to prevent and control the pandemic. This article provides a blend of discussions on the contribution of these digital technologies, propose several complementary and multidisciplinary techniques to combat COVID-19, offer opportunities for more holistic studies, and accelerate knowledge acquisition and scientific discoveries in pandemic research. First, four areas, where IoT can contribute are discussed, namely: 1) tracking and tracing; 2) remote patient monitoring (RPM) by wearable IoT (WIoT); 3) personal digital twins (PDTs); and 4) real-life use case: ICT/IoT solution in South Korea. Second, the role and novel applications of AI are explained, namely: 1) diagnosis and prognosis; 2) risk prediction; 3) vaccine and drug development; 4) research data set; 5) early warnings and alerts; 6) social control and fake news detection; and 7) communication and chatbot. Third, the main uses of robotics and drone technology are analyzed, including: 1) crowd surveillance; 2) public announcements; 3) screening and diagnosis; and 4) essential supply delivery. Finally, we discuss how distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), of which blockchain is a common example, can be combined with other technologies for tackling COVID-19.},

   abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is becoming an essential part of remote health monitoring due to the evolution of medical wireless sensors and intelligent communication technologies. IoT-based healthcare applications are employed in the medical centers to provide continuous health monitoring of a patient. However, recent smart medical devices have limited resources to handle the huge amount of healthcare data. IoMT faces several challenging issues, like security, privacy, anonymity, and interoperability. In data aggregation and communication, the privacy and security of medical information is a demanding task. Therefore, we proposed a suitable scheme to overcome the limitations of existing research studies. This paper presents an Efficient and Secure Data Transmission and Aggregation (ESDTA) scheme to enhance aggregation efficiency and data security. Our proposed work provides secure data aggregation and data forwarding of healthcare parameter values by employing the Secure Message Aggregation (SMA) algorithm and Secure Message Decryption (SMD) algorithm at the Mobile Node (MN) and Fog Node (FN), respectively. From a security perspective, the proposed scheme preserves the data integrity and also protect against several security threats like data fabrication and replay attack. The proposed scenario is simulated through simulation tool NS 2.35. The simulation results prove that aggregation at the MN effectively reduces transmission and communication costs. Furthermore, the effective computation at the FN minimizes the storage and computational cost at the cloud server. Thus, the analysis of the proposed scheme shows the supremacy of our proposed work. We compare our scheme with other related secure data aggregation-based schemes in terms of communication cost, energy consumption, resilience, storage and computational cost.},

This study aimed to explore the environmental barriers and facilitators to the successful development and implementation of virtual care technologies in this fast-paced context. We interviewed eight staff at a virtual hospital in Australia. We found key facilitators to be a learning organizational culture and strong leadership support. Barriers included interoperability issues, legislative constraints and unrealistic clinician expectations. Also, we found that a combination of hot-desking and the lack of single sign on in the virtual care environment, was reported to create additional work for staff. Overall, despite this unique context, our findings are consistent with prior work examining design and implementation of healthcare technologies. The fast pace and high-pressure environment appeared to magnify previously reported barriers, but also cultivate and foster a learning culture.},

The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

   abstract = {In the age of intelligent gadgets and interconnected communities, the widespread surveillance and provision of healthcare to patients are made feasible through the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). The number of implanted electronic devices that can be monitored remotely is increasing, leading to a rise in the amount and intricacy of biological data. The collected data can offer valuable diagnostic information that can be used to intervene and maintain implanted devices promptly, therefore enhancing the quality of treatment provided. Current remote monitoring processes are not fully using device diagnostics because of the lack of compatibility and data integration between exclusive applications and Digital Health Record (DHR) platforms. Establishing a technology framework that establishes information and enhances interoperability has the potential to strengthen remote monitoring. This article introduces the Medical Data Integration and Interoperability via Remote Monitoring of Healthcare Devices (MDII-RMHD) framework, which facilitates the collaboration of healthcare devices. MDII-RMHD enhances a cloud-based IoMT system using conversion resources at the network's boundary. This is achieved through the use of inquiring and conversion agents. The investigating devices keep track of a list of MDII-RMHD devices on the regional network and allow one device to seek information conversion from another gadget when the requesting device cannot do the task independently. The converting agent transforms the data into the necessary format and returns it to the original entity. These agents enable IoMT devices to utilize their surplus computational capabilities for data translations, reducing the need for cloud access. Conventional devices are compatible with fog resource managers that have MDII-RMHD support. We assess the MDII-RMHD framework by rigorous experimentation under different scenarios. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed framework decreases the amount of uplink traffic and enhances the response time. This improvement in response time is significant for real-time healthcare applications. © 2024, Innovative Information Science and Technology Research Group. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The wearable tech revolution and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets have created exciting new opportunities for remote patient monitoring. Healthcare providers are increasingly utilizing wearable technologies to expedite the process of diagnosis and treatment. The healthcare and research fields have been substantially impacted by emerging technologies. On the other hand, there are legitimate worries regarding the security of data transfers and transaction recording upon using these technologies. Healthcare departments need easy data interchange for interoperability. Protecting data security and integrity is crucial when exchanging information with authorized parties. In many existing solutions, patients’ sensitive data is collected and stored in smart healthcare systems. Scalability, breach or unauthorized access to this data can compromise privacy. The adoption of blockchain technology is one way to safeguard patient privacy in healthcare. Also, by facilitating the safe and secure exchange of data, blockchain technology is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by making traditional methods of diagnosis and treatment more reliable. However, blockchain has serious problems with its highly limited scalability. This article suggests a new method “SHORTBLOCKS” depending on blockchain technology for the safe administration and analysis of data. To circumvent the security-scalability issue and achieve high throughput, this study employs the newly introduced protocol “SHORTBLOCKS”, which extends blockchain concept to a direct acyclic graph of blocks. The proposed system uses both a private and a public blockchain that are created on the new protocol. In order to analyze patient health data, a system using smart contracts and a private blockchain is built. The system logs the occurrence to the public blockchain in the case that the smart contract raises an alarm due to an unusual reading. This will fix the scalability issue with initial blockchain as well as the security and privacy issues involved in remote patient monitoring. Simulation results shows the performance of the proposed system by comparing with existing solutions, SPECTRE protocol and GHOSTDAG protocol. © 2024 SCPE.},

Existing solutions for IoT in healthcare have notable limitations, such as closed-source, limited I/O protocols, limited cloud platform support, and missing specific functionality for health use cases. Developing an open-source internet of things (IoT) gateway solution that addresses these limitations and provides reliability, broad applicability, and utility is highly desirable. Combining a wide range of sensor data streams from IoT devices with ambulatory mHealth data would open up the potential to provide a detailed 360-degree view of the relationship between patient physiology, behavior, and environment. We have developed RADAR-IoT as an open-source IoT gateway framework, to harness this potential. It aims to connect multiple IoT devices at the edge, perform limited on-device data processing and analysis, and integrate with cloud-based mobile health platforms, such as RADAR-base, enabling real-time data processing. We also present a proof-of-concept data collection from this framework, using prototype hardware in two locations. The RADAR-IoT framework, combined with the RADAR-base mHealth platform, provides a comprehensive view of a user’s health and environment by integrating static IoT sensors and wearable devices.

The system consists of multiple sensors, each connected wirelessly to an edge device, acting as a wireless communication gateway to a remote server. The system initiates information handshaking between the sensor adapters and edge device at the beginning of the operation, which is later used to detect the sensor settings to process the data received from the sensor. The system is scalable and dynamically accommodates multiple sensors without any predefined ontologies at the edge device. The implementation of our system avoids dependencies on a system's physical ports. The low form factor and wireless connectivity of the adapter make the system portable and convenient for in-home health monitoring. Additionally, the system allows multiple homogeneous sensors to operate at the same time in the same system. We implement and evaluate our system with a 3-lead ECG, pulse, and temperature sensors against two different network configurations - star and mesh. We use the data set generated from our implemented system for performance analysis.

   abstract = {The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended version of the Internet of Things that is acting a starring role in data sharing remotely. These remote data sources consist of physiological processes, such as treatment progress, patient monitoring, and consultation. The main purpose of IoHT platform is to intervene independently from geographically remote areas by providing low-cost preventive or active healthcare services. Several low-power biomedical sensors with limited computing capabilities provide IoHT's communication, integration, computation, and interoperability. However, IoHT transfers IoT data via IP-centric Internet, which has implications for security and privacy. To address this issue, in this paper, we suggest using named data networking (NDN), a future Internet model that is well suited for mobile patients and caregivers. As the IoHT contains a lot of personal information about a user's physical condition, which can be detrimental to users' finances and health if leaked, therefore, data protection is important in the IoHT. Experts and scholars have researched this area, but the reconstruction of existing schemes could be further improved. Also, doing computing-intensive tasks leads to slower response times, which further worsens the performance of IoHT. We are trying to resolve such an error, so a new NDN-based certificateless signcryption scheme is proposed for IoHT using the security hardness of the hyperelliptic curve cryptosystem. Security analysis and comparisons with existing schemes show the viability of the designed scheme. The final results confirm that the designed scheme provides better security with minimal computational and communicational resources. Finally, we validate the security of the designed scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks using the AVISPA tool.  © 2021 Aroosa et al.},

   abstract = {The emergence of biomedical sensor devices, wireless communication, and innovation in other technologies for healthcare applications result in the evolution of a new area of research that is termed as Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). WBAN originates from Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), which are used for implementing many healthcare systems integrated with networks and wireless devices to ensure remote healthcare monitoring. WBAN is a network of wearable devices implanted in or on the human body. The main aim of WBAN is to collect the human vital signs/physiological data (like ECG, body temperature, EMG, glucose level, etc.) round-the-clock from patients that demand secure, optimal and efficient routing techniques. The efficient, secure, and reliable designing of routing protocol is a difficult task in WBAN due to its diverse characteristic and restraints, such as energy consumption and temperature-rise of implanted sensors. The two significant constraints, overheating of nodes and energy efficiency must be taken into account while designing a reliable blockchain-enabled WBAN routing protocol. The purpose of this study is to achieve stability and efficiency in the routing of WBAN through managing temperature and energy limitations. Moreover, the blockchain provides security, transparency, and lightweight solution for the interoperability of physiological data with other medical personnel in the healthcare ecosystem. In this research work, the blockchain-based Adaptive Thermal-/Energy-Aware Routing (ATEAR) protocol for WBAN is proposed. Temperature rise, energy consumption, and throughput are the evaluation metrics considered to analyze the performance of ATEAR for data transmission. In contrast, transaction throughput, latency, and resource utilization are used to investigate the outcome of the blockchain system. Hyperledger Caliper, a benchmarking tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the blockchain system in terms of CPU utilization, memory, and memory utilization. The results show that by preserving residual energy and avoiding overheated nodes as forwarders, high throughput is achieved with the ultimate increase of the network lifetime. Castalia, a simulation tool, is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol, and its comparison is made with Multipath Ring Routing Protocol (MRRP), thermal-aware routing algorithm (TARA), and Shortest-Hop (SHR). Evaluation results illustrate that the proposed protocol performs significantly better in balancing of temperature (to avoid damaging heat effect on the body tissues) and energy consumption (to prevent the replacement of battery and to increase the embedded sensor node life) with efficient data transmission achieving a high throughput value. © MDPI AG.

IoMT integrates medical devices for real-time data analysis and transmission but faces challenges in data security and interoperability. This research identifies a significant gap in the existing literature regarding a comprehensive ontology for vulnerabilities in medical IoT devices. This paper proposes a fundamental domain ontology named MIoT (Medical Internet of Things) ontology, focusing on cybersecurity in IoMT (Internet of Medical Things), particularly in remote patient monitoring settings. This research will refer to similar-looking acronyms, IoMT and MIoT ontology. It is important to distinguish between the two. IoMT is a collection of various medical devices and their applications within the research domain. On the other hand, MIoT ontology refers to the proposed ontology that defines various concepts, roles, and individuals. MIoT ontology utilizes the knowledge engineering methodology outlined in Ontology Development 101, along with the structured life cycle, and establishes semantic interoperability among medical devices to secure IoMT assets from vulnerabilities and cyberattacks. By defining key concepts and relationships, it becomes easier to understand and analyze the complex network of information within the IoMT. The MIoT ontology captures essential key terms and security-related entities for future extensions. A conceptual model is derived from the MIoT ontology and validated through a case study. Furthermore, this paper outlines a roadmap for future research, highlighting potential impacts on security automation in healthcare applications. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Background: Technological advances allow for recording and sharing health-related data in a patient-centric way using smartphones and wearables. Secure sharing of such patient-generated data with physicians would enable close management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric design. Objective: The objective of this study was to conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. Methods: The RPM system requirements were established through focus group sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility, the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective randomized interventional study focusing on dilated cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12 months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear regression with 95% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group membership. Results: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a notification service. The system was evaluated with 95 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29% female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study protocol. The system’s app achieved a mean System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device experience. In total, 87% (83/95) of the patients could integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily routine, and 71% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for management of their health condition. On average, patients interacted with the wearable on 61% (SD 26%) of days enrolled in the study. SHD were available on average for 78% (SD 23%) of days, and PROM data were available on 64% (SD 27%) of weeks enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group membership. Conclusions: Our results mark a first step toward integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into patients’ daily routines. © Reto Wettstein, Farbod Sedaghat-Hamedani, Oliver Heinze, Ali Amr, Christoph Reich, Theresa Betz, Elham Kayvanpour, Angela Merzweiler, Christopher Büsch, Isabell Mohr, Birgit Friedmann-Bette, Norbert Frey, Martin Dugas, Benjamin Meder.},

   abstract = {eHealth is the use of modern information and communication technology (ICT) for trans-institutional healthcare purposes. Important subtopics of eHealth are health data sharing and telemedicine. Most of the clinical documentation to be shared is collected in patient records to support patient care. More sophisticated approaches to electronic patient records are trans-institutional or (inter-)national. Other aims for clinical documentation are quality management, reimbursement, legal issues, and medical research. Basic prerequisite for eHealth is interoperability, which can be divided into technical, semantic and process interoperability. There is a variety of international standards to support interoperability. Telemedicine is a subtopic of eHealth, which bridges spatial distance by using ICT for medical (inter-)actions. We distinguish telemedicine among healthcare professionals and telemedicine between health care professionals and patients. Both have a great potential to face the challenges of aging societies, the increasing number of chronically ill patients, multimorbidity and low number of physicians in remote areas. With ongoing digitalization more and more data are available digitally. Clinical documentation is an important source for big data analysis and artificial intelligence. The patient has an important role: Telemonitoring, wearable technologies, and smart home devices provide digital health data from daily life. These are high-quality data which can be used for medical decisions. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {The Internet of Health Things (IoHT) is an extended breed of the Internet of Things (IoT), which plays an important role in the remote sharing of data from various physical processes such as patient monitoring, treatment progress, observation, and consultation. The key benefit of the IoHT platform is the ease of time-independent interaction from geographically distant locations by offering preventive or proactive healthcare services at a lower cost. The communication, integration, computation, and interoperability in IoHT are provided by various low-power biomedical sensors equipped with limited computational capabilities. Therefore, conventional cryptographic solutions are not feasible for the majority of IoHT applications. In addition, executing computing-intensive tasks will lead to a slow response time that can deteriorate the performance of IoHT. We strive to resolve such a deficiency, and thus a new scheme has been proposed in this article, called an online-offline signature scheme in certificateless settings. The scheme divides the signing part into two phases, i.e., online and offline. In the absence of a message, the offline phase performs computationally intensive tasks, while lighter computations are executed in the online phase when there is a message. Security analyses and comparisons with the respective existing schemes are carried out to show the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The results obtained authenticate that the proposed scheme offers enhanced security with lower computational and communication costs.  © 2020 Muhammad Asghar Khan et al.},

   abstract = {The fourth industrial revolution (4IR or Industry 4.0), its communication and information enabling technologies are revolutionizing the production and services applications. In the healthcare domain, electronic health (eHealth) is evolving towards healthcare 4.0 through the Internet of things, big data analytics, Cloud and Fog computing technologies. There is need for early cancer detection, which can be achieved by new imaging technologies for example Terahertz imaging and Infrared thermography. The integration of such new imaging modalities and wearable sensor networks with computer aided diagnosis systems (CAD) and IoT systems with interconnectivity and interoperability could enable continuous, remote observation of cancer diagnosed patients by experts to monitor the success of treatment procedures, side effects of drugs, statistical analysis and making predictions of cancer based on age and demographics etc. for timely intervention and personalized care. In the healthcare 4.0 paradigm, there is need not only for smart diagnosis but also care through remote patient monitoring. The vital signs associated with cancer and clinical information can be integrated to make the system culminate into a smart system with health records. This work proposes an IoT enabled deep learning framework for classification of breast images; we propose the development of both custom CNN model and fine-tuned, pretrained CNN models capable of multimodal image classification. IoT simulation and cloud processing is performed in the ThingSpeak cloud platform with email alert capability. The performance of the CNN models has been evaluated using the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics which achieved 98.44%, 98.44% and 98.45% respectively for the custom CNN model together with the receiver operating characteristics curves and confusion matrices. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

   abstract = {Current m-Health scenarios in the smart living era, as the interpretation of the smart city at each person’s level, present several challenges associated with interoperability between different clinical devices and applications. The Continua Health Alliance establishes design guidelines to standardize application communication to guarantee interoperability among medical devices. In this paper, we describe the implementation of two IEEE agents for oxygen saturation level (SpO2) measurements and electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquisition, respectively, and a smartphone IEEE manager for validation. We developed both IEEE agents over the Bluetooth Health Device Profile following the Continua guidelines and they are part of a telemonitoring system. This system was evaluated in a sample composed of 10 volunteers (mean age 29.8 ± 7.1 y/o; 5 females) under supervision of an expert cardiologist. The evaluation consisted of measuring the SpO2 and ECG signal sitting and at rest, before and after exercising for 15 min. Physiological measurements were assessed and compared against commercial devices, and our expert physician did not find any relevant differences in the ECG signal. Additionally, the system was assessed when acquiring and processing different heart rate data to prove that warnings were generated when the heart rate was under/above the thresholds for bradycardia and tachycardia, respectively. © 2022 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, health services around the globe are struggling. An effective system for monitoring patients can improve healthcare delivery by avoiding in-person contacts, enabling early-detection of severe cases, and remotely assessing patients’ status. Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been used for monitoring patients’ health with wireless wearable sensors in different scenarios and medical conditions, such as noncommunicable and infectious diseases. Combining IoT-related technologies with early-warning scores (EWS) commonly utilized in infirmaries has the potential to enhance health services delivery significantly. Specifically, the NEWS-2 has been showing remarkable results in detecting the health deterioration of COVID-19 patients. Although the literature presents several approaches for remote monitoring, none of these studies proposes a customized, complete, and integrated architecture that uses an effective early-detection mechanism for COVID-19 and that is flexible enough to be used in hospital wards and at home. Therefore, this article's objective is to present a comprehensive IoT-based conceptual architecture that addresses the key requirements of scalability, interoperability, network dynamics, context discovery, reliability, and privacy in the context of remote health monitoring of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and at home. Since remote monitoring of patients at home (essential during a pandemic) can engender trust issues regarding secure and ethical data collection, a consent management module was incorporated into our architecture to provide transparency and ensure data privacy. Further, the article details mechanisms for supporting a configurable and adaptable scoring system embedded in wearable devices to increase usefulness and flexibility for health care professions working with EWS. © 2021},

   abstract = {Pervasive healthcare services have evolved substantially in the recent years with IoMT rapidly changing the pace and scale of healthcare delivery. A promising application of IoMT is to fetch patterns of mental behaviour symptomatology based on bio-signals and transfer it to the corresponding hospital or psychologist for remote monitoring. But the data volume performance, device diversity interoperability, hacking unauthorized use and acceptance adoption barriers still restrain the practical and competent use of these devices. This research presents a plausible solution to surmount the data overload and processing latency in real-time sensory data collected through wearable devices for mental health monitoring. We propose a modified k-medoid data clustering technique based on time-frame restricted intra-cluster similarity calculations to obtain a summarized version of the original benchmark WESAD dataset for which the degree of information lost is minimum. A CNN is then trained on this summarized dataset for classification of mental state into the baseline, stress and amusement categories. The results show a significant reduction in the average execution time by 34% with a comparable accuracy to the original dataset, thus offering prompt real-time healthcare analytics. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},
