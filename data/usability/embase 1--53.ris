N2  - INTRODUCTION: Over the past two decades, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of digital technologies within healthcare and also in midwifery. However, scarce literature exist on the use of digital technologies and applications in midwifery practice particularly in the Belgian setting. AIM: To map the use of digital technologies and applications by midwives in various settings, encompassing hospitals, primary care, and educational institutions in Belgium. METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to collect data via an online questionnaire targeting at midwives working in the Flemish region, Walloon region, or Brussels-Capital region. Midwives were either Dutch-speaking or French-speaking (n = 212). The semi-structured questionnaire addressed three domains: (1) socio-demographics, (2) employment information (3) the use of digital technology, including the level of comfort with technology. Qualtrics© program was used for managing data and SPSS v28.0© for data analysis using descriptive statistics, Chi² analysis, and independent sample t-test. The study adhered to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology reporting guidelines. RESULTS: Among respondents, 58% reported the use of digital technologies and applications, with electronic health records (89.6%), electronic prescriptions (65.6%), and remote patient monitoring (51.2%) commonly utilized. Sensor technology (7.2%), mixed care (3.8%), care robots (2.5%), and wearable devices (1.9%) were very rarely used. The target groups for these digital technologies and applications generally encompass all stages of the perinatal period. Midwives felt overall highly confident with these technologies. Younger participants and those with a Master's or PhD degree exhibited greater comfort scores in digital technology use. No significant relationships were observed between socio-demographic characteristics and the adoption of digital technology. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the potential for incorporating digital technologies and applications into various midwifery care settings. Addressing barriers and enhancing usability can optimize technology integration, contributing to personalized high-quality care, ultimately improving perinatal health outcomes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Technological advances allow for recording and sharing health-related data in a patient-centric way using smartphones and wearables. Secure sharing of such patient-generated data with physicians would enable close management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. METHODS: The RPM system requirements were established through focus group sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility, the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective randomized interventional study focusing on dilated cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12 months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear regression with 95% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group membership. RESULTS: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a notification service. The system was evaluated with 95 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29% female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study protocol. The system's app achieved a mean System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device experience. In total, 87% (83/95) of the patients could integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily routine, and 71% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for management of their health condition. On average, patients interacted with the wearable on 61% (SD 26%) of days enrolled in the study. SHD were available on average for 78% (SD 23%) of days, and PROM data were available on 64% (SD 27%) of weeks enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group membership. CONCLUSIONS: Our results mark a first step toward integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into patients' daily routines.

N2  - Footwear smart devices capable of reliably capturing body actions and conveniently transmitting human-made information are of great interest to advance healthcare monitoring, human-machine interactions (HMIs), etc. while remaining challenging. Herein, we present a self-powered, antislip, and multifunctional smart outsole based on the gecko toe-inspired tilted magnetized flakes (TMFs) and underlying flexible coils. With the pressure-induced flake deflection and the built-in magnetic moment alignment, the TMF can produce a variable magnetic field to induce the voltage signals in coils for precise pressure perception and linear velocity sensing. The TMF-based smart outsole can thus serve as a real-time footwear recorder to monitor various body actions for exercise analysis and to track the abnormal landing speed for alerting potential injuries. The gecko toe-like flakes also enable the excellent antislip capability of the outsole with a much higher friction coefficient than the standard one of the low slip risk. By programming the magnetic moment alignments of the TMFs, a single-circuit outsole can further output multiple signals as encoded instructions for controlling the racing game. Along with excellent abrasion resistance and environmental immunity, the proposed outsole exhibits great potential as a convenient platform for reliable healthcare monitoring and efficient HMI.

N2  - Background: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Current VAD controllers offer improved interactivity, yet limitations of the visual, tactile, and auditory interface persist that impact patient experience and quality of life (QoL). This study explores how VAD controllers can be redesigned using a human-centered design approach to enhance the emotional and functional experience of the device for patients. Methods: VAD patients (n = 21), caregivers (n = 4) and healthcare practitioners (n = 24) were interviewed to uncover design opportunities. From this, a series of realistic scenarios to design for emerged. A “design by analogy” method took inspiration from existing consumer products to ideate new functionality for the VAD wearable system, creating concepts for a controller interface and paired wearable device. An additional 15 patients and 2 caregivers were engaged to explore current VAD controller experiences and evaluate the future-state concepts. Results: This research validated the need for increased automation and emergency functionality in VAD controllers, including remote monitoring of data, accurate communication of battery status, and automated medical alerts for critical device alarms. “Manage my health,” “Feeling normal,” “Social belonging,” “Feeling safe,” and “Sense of control” emerged as key patient concerns to be met by future VAD controller designs. Conclusions: The study demonstrated an innovative and relevant approach to improve usability of future VAD peripherals. By considering both emotional and functional perspectives in the design of lifesaving medical devices such as VADs, device manufacturers can uncover new opportunities to improve patient QoL through improved user experiences.

N2  - Successful implementation of remote monitoring of vital signs outside of the hospital setting hinges on addressing three crucial unmet needs: longer-term wear, skin comfort and signal quality. Earlier, we developed a Health Patch research platform that uses self-adhesive dry electrodes to measure vital digital biomarkers. Here, we report on the analytical validation for heart rate, heart rate variability and respiration rate. Study design included n = 25 adult participants with data acquisition during a 30-minute exercise protocol involving rest, squats, slow, and fast cycling. The Shimmer3 ECG Unit and Cosmed K5, were reference devices. Data analysis showed good agreement in heart rate and marginal agreement in respiratory rate, with lower agreement towards higher respiratory rates. The Lin's concordance coefficient was 0.98 for heart rate and 0.56 for respiratory rate. Heart rate variability (RMSSD) had a coefficient of 0.85. Participants generally expressed a positive experience with the technology, with some minor irritation from the medical adhesive. The results highlighted potential of this technology for short-to-medium term clinical use for cardiorespiratory health, due to its reliability, accuracy, and compact design. Such technology could become instrumental for remote monitoring providing healthcare professionals with continuous data, remote assessment and enhancing patient outcomes in cardiorespiratory health management.

N2  - Background: Remote monitoring systems have the potential to measure symptoms and treatment effects in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home environment. However, information about user experience and long-term compliance of such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD symptoms is lacking. Objective: The aim was to gain insight into user experience and long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to report falls and receive feedback of data. Methods: We analyzed the data of the “Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home” study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify determinants of 1-year compliance. Results: We included 200 PwP (mean age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year compliance. Conclusions: The 1-year compliance with this specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, except battery life and data transfer. Future studies can build on these findings by incorporating a smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues.

N2  - Background: Multi-parametric assessment, including heart sounds in addition to conventional parameters, may enhance the efficacy of noninvasive telemonitoring for heart failure (HF). We sought to assess the feasibility of self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder and its association with clinical events in patients with HF. Methods: Ambulatory HF patients recorded their own heart sounds, mono‑lead electrocardiograms, oxygen saturation, body weight, and vital signs using multiple devices every morning for six months. Results: In the 77 patients enrolled (63 ± 13 years old, 84 % male), daily measurements were feasible with a self-measurement rate of >70 % of days in 75 % of patients. Younger age and higher Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire scores were independently associated with lower adherence (p = 0.002 and 0.027, respectively). A usability questionnaire showed that 87 % of patients felt self-telemonitoring was helpful, and 96 % could use the devices without routine cohabitant support. Six patients experienced ten HF events of re-hospitalization and/or unplanned hospital visits due to HF. In patients who experienced HF events, a significant increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and a decrease in the time interval from Q wave onset to the second heart sound were observed 7 days before the events compared with those without HF events. Conclusions: Self-telemonitoring with multiple devices including a handheld heart sound recorder was feasible even in elderly patients with HF. This intervention may confer a sense of relief to patients and enable monitoring of physiological parameters that could be valuable in detecting the deterioration of HF.

N2  - The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study, a multi-site prospective longitudinal cohort study, will examine human brain, cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional development beginning prenatally and planned through early childhood. Wearable and remote sensing technologies have advanced data collection outside of laboratory settings to enable exploring, in more detail, the associations of early experiences with brain development and social and health outcomes. In the HBCD Study, the Novel Technology/Wearable Sensors Working Group (WG-NTW) identified two primary data types to be collected: infant activity (by measuring leg movements) and sleep (by measuring heart rate and leg movements). These wearable technologies allow for remote collection in the natural environment. This paper illustrates the collection of such data via wearable technologies and describes the decision-making framework, which led to the currently deployed study design, data collection protocol, and derivatives, which will be made publicly available. Moreover, considerations regarding actual and potential challenges to adoption and use, data management, privacy, and participant burden were examined. Lastly, the present limitations in the field of wearable sensor data collection and analysis will be discussed in terms of extant validation studies, the difficulties in comparing performance across different devices, and the impact of evolving hardware/software/firmware.

N2  - Background: More responsive, reliable, and clinically valid endpoints of disability are essential to reduce size, duration, and burden of clinical trials in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy (aPwSMA). Objective: The aim is to investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. Methods: Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified for all SDMs. Results: The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both mobility and dexterity (ICC>0.75 for 14/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both non-sitters (Typing, ρ=0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ=0.75). In walkers, the highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ=0.79). Conclusions: This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in aPwSMA.

N2  - The Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study (SPHYNCS) is a multicenter research initiative to identify new biomarkers in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH). Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters over 1 year. We examined the feasibility of long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a adherence metric to evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an overall adherence rate of 80% over 1 year. We calculated daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from 2 weeks of greatest adherence to compare NT1 (n=20) and HC (n=9) participants. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation, including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p=.007) and awakening index (p=.025), as well as standard deviation of time in bed (p=.044). Moreover, NT1 patients exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p=.019), and sleep latency (p=.001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p=.008), heart rate standard deviation (p=.039) and high-intensity activity (p=.009) compared to HC. This ongoing study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that long-term wearable technology may play a future role in diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.

Displays such as alternative current electroluminescence|alternative current electroluminescent (ACEL) devices with high flexibility and long operational lifetimes are essential for wearable electronics. However, ACEL devices are constrained by their inherent high driving voltage and complex fabrication processes. Our work presents an easy blade-coating method for fabricating flexible ACEL display devices based on an all-solution process. By dispersing BaTiO3 and ZnS/Cu powder into waterborne polyurethane, we successfully combined dielectric and fluorescence functionalities within a single layer, significantly reducing the device's driving voltage. Additionally, the ionic conducting hydrogel was chosen as a transparent electrode to achieve good electrical contact and strong interfacial adhesion through in situ polymerization. Owing to the unique method, our ACEL device exhibits high flexibility, low driving voltage (20-100 V), high brightness (300+ cd/m2 at 60 V), and environmental friendliness. Furthermore, by repurposing the hydrogel electrode, we integrated strain visualization capabilities within a single device, highlighting its potential for applications such as wearable healthcare monitoring.

N2  - Background: Mobile technology is increasingly prevalent in healthcare, serving various purposes, including remote health monitoring and patient self-management, which could prove beneficial to early hospital discharges. Aims: This study investigates the transitional care program experience facilitating early discharges in a pediatric setting through the use of an easy-to-use mobile medical device (TytoCare™, TytoCare Ltd., Natanya, Israel). Outcomes: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of telehomecare in achieving complete resolution of diseases without readmission, compare the length of stay between intervention and standard care groups, and gather user and professional experiences. Methods: A randomized open-label, controlled pilot study enrolled 102 children, randomly assigned to the telehomecare (TELE) group (n = 51, adopting early hospital discharge with continued home monitoring) or the standard-of-care (STAND) group (n = 51). Primary outcomes include complete disease resolution without readmission. Secondary objectives include recording a shorter length of stay in the intervention group. Surveys on user and professional experiences were conducted. A group of 51 children declining telemedicine services (NO-TELE) was also included. Results: In the TELE group, 100% of children achieved complete disease resolution without readmission, with a median duration of stay of 4 days, significantly shorter than the 7 days in the STAND group (p = 0.01). The telemedicine system demonstrated efficient performance and high satisfaction levels. The NO-TELE group showed no significant differences in demographics or digital technology competence. Perceived benefits of telemedicine included time and cost savings, reduced hospital stays, and technology utility and usability. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that user-friendly mobile medical devices effectively facilitate early hospital discharges in a pediatric setting. These devices serve as a bridge between home and hospital, optimizing care pathways.

N2  - Background: Malnutrition is a common and distressing condition among pancreatic cancer patients. Fewer than a quarter of pancreatic cancer patients receive medical nutrition therapy (MNT), important for improving nutritional status, weight maintenance, quality of life and survival. System, provider, and patient level barriers limit access to MNT. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week multi-level, digital health intervention designed to expand MNT access among pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: Individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer starting chemotherapy (N = 80) will be 1:1 randomized to the intervention or usual care. The Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) intervention includes system-level (e.g., routine malnutrition and screening), provider-level (e.g., dietitian training and web-based dashboard), and patient-level strategies (e.g., individualized nutrition plan, self-monitoring of dietary intake via Fitbit, ongoing goal monitoring and feedback). Individuals receiving usual care will be referred to dietitians based on their oncologists’ discretion. Study assessments will be completed at baseline, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-weeks. Results: Primary outcomes will be feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment completion) and acceptability. We will collect additional implementation outcomes, such as intervention adherence, perceived usability, and feedback on intervention quality via an exit interview. We will collect preliminary data on outcomes that may be associated with the intervention including malnutrition, quality of life, treatment outcomes, and survival. Conclusion: This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of a digital health intervention to reduce malnutrition among individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer. Trial registration: NCT05675059, registered on December 9, 2022.

N2  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress-strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress-strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Smartphones are often equipped with inertial sensors that measure individuals' physical activity (PA). However, their role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. RESULTS: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA tracker's total number of steps (χ21=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a patient's PA.

N2  - Remote patient monitoring (RPM) is an innovative strategy to promote health and improve patient management and care. Recent advances in healthcare technologies have seen the emergence of wearable sensors allowing longitudinal physiological measurements in any environment. This paper introduces a wireless wearable patch 'Leo' for continuous remote monitoring of physiological data at home and healthcare settings. This includes single lead ECG, chest impedance, heart rate (HR), respiration rate (RR) and body posture. To test Leo's ability to capture longitudinal physiological data at home, 15 children experiencing acute severe asthma exacerbations were recruited during their emergency department (ED) visits. Participants wore the Leo device for 7 (+/-2) days post-hospital discharge. Nocturnal RR and HR and variability were higher during the first half of the night on Day1 compared to Day7 (p<0.005). Participants also completed a usability questionnaire and reported the patch wear to be comfortable (average score of 3.3 out of 5) and easy to wear during the night (average score of 3.5 out of 5) with 5/15 (33%) reported very slight barely perceptible skin irritation/redness and 2 (13%) reported well defined skin irritation and redness.Clinical Relevance- These results highlight the potential use of the Leo device in clinical practice for continuous un-obstructive monitoring of diseased populations, such as asthma.

N2  - Assisted living services have become increasingly important in recent years as the population ages and the demand for personalized care rises. In this paper, we present the integration of wearable IoT devices in a remote monitoring platform for elderly people that enables seamless data collection, analysis, and visualization while in parallel, alarms and notification functionalities are provided in the context of a personalized monitoring and care plan. The system has been implemented using state-of-the-art technologies and methods to facilitate robust operation, increased usability and real-time communication. The user has the ability to record and visualise their activity, health and alarm data using the tracking devices, and additionally settle an ecosystem of relatives and informal carers to provide assistance daily or support in cases of emergencies.

N2  - Aims: In heart failure (HF), implantable haemodynamic monitoring devices have been shown to optimize therapy, anticipating clinical decompensation and preventing hospitalization. Direct left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer theoretical benefits beyond pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We evaluated the safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. Methods and results: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human, prospective, multicentre, single-arm, clinical trial enrolling 30 patients with HF. The device consisted of an interatrial positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly. After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to correlate mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with simultaneous mean LAP obtained from the device. Remote LAP measurements were then used to guide patient management. The miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30 patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological events (MACNE). At 3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was 97%. Agreement between sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was consistent, with a mean difference of −0.22 ± 4.92 mmHg, the correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776 (95% confidence interval 0.582–0.886), respectively. Preliminary experience with V-LAP-based HF management was associated with significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (32% of patients reached NYHA class II at 6 months, p < 0.005; 60% of patients at 12 months, p < 0.005) and 6-min walk test distance (from 244.59 ± 119.59 m at baseline to 311.78 ± 129.88 m after 6 months, p < 0.05, and 343.95 ± 146.15 m after 12 months, p < 0.05). Conclusion: The V-LAP™ monitoring system proved to be generally safe and provided a good correlation with invasive PCWP. Initial evidence also suggests possible improvement in HF clinical symptoms.

N2  - Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼-0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints.

N2  - Background and Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and symptoms for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) has become increasingly relevant in many situations. Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5-8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback.

N2  - Small-scale and high-performance energy storage devices have drawn tremendous attention with their portable, lightweight, and multi-functionalized features. Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics.

N2  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices.

N2  - BACKGROUND: With the increase in concern for deaths and illness related to the increase in temperature globally, there is a growing need for real-time monitoring of workers for heat stress indicators. The purpose of this study was to determine the usability of the Slate Safety (SS) wearable physiological monitoring system. METHODS: Twenty nurses performed a common task in a moderate or hot environment while wearing the SS device, the Polar 10 monitor, and having taken the e-Celsius ingestible pill. Data from each device was compared for correlation and accuracy. RESULTS: High correlation was determined between the SS wearable device and the Polar 10 system (0.926) and the ingestible pill (0.595). The SS was comfortable to wear and easily monitored multiple participants from a distance. CONCLUSIONS: The Slate Safety wearable device demonstrated accuracy in measuring core temperature and heart rate while not restricting the motion of the worker, and provided a remote monitoring platform for physiological parameters.

N2  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which requires complex medication regimens to mitigate motor symptoms. The use of digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Methods: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. Results: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for its usability. Usability of the DHTS was significantly associated with age (ρ = −0.560, BCa 95% CI [−0.791, −0.207]). This study identified means to improve usability of the DHTS by addressing technical and design issues of the smartwatch. Feasibility, usability and acceptability were identified as key themes from PwP qualitative feedback on the DHTS. Conclusion: This study highlighted the feasibility and usability of our integrated DHTS to remotely assess medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Further work is necessary to determine whether this DHTS can be implemented for clinical decision-making to optimise management of PwP.

N2  - Introduction: Objective and continuous monitoring of physical activity over the long-term in the community is perhaps the most important step in the paradigm shift toward evidence-based practice and personalized therapy for successful community integration. With the advancement in technology, physical activity monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use of physical activity monitors at different wear locations. However, there are no studies that have looked at the feasibility and patient perspectives on long-term utilization of activity monitors in individuals with acquired brain injury. Methods: This pilot study aims to fill this gap and understand patient-reported aspects of the feasibility of using physical activity monitors for long-term use in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury. Results: This pilot study found that patients with acquired brain injury faced challenges specific to their functional limitations and that the activity monitors worn on the waist or wrist may be better suited in this population. Discussion: The unique wear location-specific challenges faced by individuals with ABI need to be taken into account when selecting wearable activity monitors for long term use in this population.

N2  - Background: Physiotherapy for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) could benefit from objective and continuous tracking of physical activity and falls in daily life. Objectives: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in daily clinical practice. Methods: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. Results: We applied thematic analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. Conclusions: Overall, both PwPD and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring technology, as illustrated by our user profiles.

N2  - Background: During the 30-day period prior to initiating dialysis, there is a 10-fold rise in emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to kidney failure. Objective: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in patients’ vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Design: A pilot prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. Setting: The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: There were 2 phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible to participate in the study. Methods: The primary quantitative outcome was adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires and focus groups. Results: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, and negative thoughts toward their health Limitations: Limitations of the study include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who are not interested in self-management of their health. Conclusion: Our results suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned.

N2  - Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring.

N2  - Background: Clinical trials often face challenges in efficient data collection and participant monitoring. To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. Methods: This article presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and efficient PBH monitoring. Results: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of clinically meaningful data. Conclusions: By leveraging IMPACT’s existing features and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, and trial customization for PBH research. The platform’s high usability underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest.

N2  - Although telehealth, and in particular RPM, have demonstrated to drive many benefits, such as reduction in cost and hospital-acquired infections, previous research has shown many usability challenges when patients operate a medical device without supervision of a medical professional. To combat this issue, the Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to continuously acquire a patient’s vital signs from a distance, without the need to attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered design process. The development of the sensor, including utilised technologies, components, and the user interface are presented, including inspirations for future work.

N2  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness.

N2  - Functional fibers have attracted much research attention due to their potential application in developing advanced electronic textiles for wearable devices. However, challenges still exist in preparing high-performance fiber-shaped sensors with superior flexibility and stretchability while achieving a high sensitivity and a wide detection range. Herein, we propose the design and fabrication of an ultra-flexible and super-elastic fiber-shaped strain sensor via a facile combining approach of wet-spinning and dip-coating. The sensor adopts a core-sheath configuration of liquid metal droplets dispersed in porous thermoplastic polyurethane as a substrate core and a carbon nanotube intertwined network embedding silver nanowires as a strain sensitive sheath. By taking advantage of both the composition of multiple functional materials and the design of a microstructured device configuration, the developed fiber-shaped sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity (maximum gauge factor of 7336.1), an extremely large workable strain range (500%), a low strain detection limit (0.5%), a fast response time (200 ms) and good stability (10 000 cycles). In addition, the sensor is temperature insensitive, inert under harsh solution conditions, degradable and recyclable. Intriguingly, the fiber-shaped sensor can be used to detect various human motions and gestures by directly attaching to skins or elaborately weaving into textiles, demonstrating its great potential in human healthcare monitoring and human-machine interactions.

T1  - Breathable and Waterproof Electronic Skin with Three-Dimensional Architecture for Pressure and Strain Sensing in Nonoverlapping Mode

KW  - human

N2  - Wearable sensors have recently attracted extensive interest not only in the field of healthcare monitoring but also for convenient and intelligent human-machine interactions. However, challenges such as wearable comfort, multiple applicable conditions, and differentiation of mechanical stimuli are yet to be fully addressed. Herein, we developed a breathable and waterproof electronic skin (E-skin) that can perceive pressure/strain with nonoverlapping signals. The synergistic effect from magnetic attraction and nanoscaled aggregation renders the E-skin with microscaled pores for breathability and three-dimensional microcilia for superhydrophobicity. Upon applied pressure, the bending of conductive microcilia enables sufficient contacts for resistance decrease, while the stretching causes increased resistance due to the separation of conductive materials. The optimized E-skin exhibits a high gauge factor of 7.747 for small strain (0-80%) and a detection limit down to 0.04%. The three-dimensional microcilia also exhibit a sensitivity of -0.0198 kPa-1 (0-3 kPa) and a broad detection range up to 200 kPa with robustness. The E-skin can reliably and precisely distinguish kinds of the human joint motions, covering a broad spectrum including bending, stretching, and pressure. With the nonoverlapping readouts, ternary inputs "1", "0", and "-1" could be produced with different stimuli, which expands the command capacity for logic outputs such as effective Morse code and intuitive robotic control. Owing to the rapid response, long-term stability (10 000 cycles), breathability, and superhydrophobicity, we believe that the E-skin can be widely applied as wearable devices from body motion monitoring to human-machine interactions toward a more convenient and intelligent future.

N2  - In recent years, stretchable and wearable strain sensors with excellent sensing performance are garnering significant research attention owing to their diverse range of application prospects in human activity monitoring, healthcare and biomedical engineering, and human-machine interaction. In this study, Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposites are constructed for strain monitoring and wearable applications. A cost-effective, environmentally benign, and scalable spray coating technique has been utilized to achieve highly conductive functional sensor materials by coating graphite nanoflakes onto the soft, epidermis-like, and highly elastic Rebound silicone elastomers. In strain monitoring, the Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake (GNF)/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposite strain sensors demonstrate high performance with a large strain sensitivity (a maximum gauge factor of 96.73), a wide sensing range of up to 50%, a fast response and recovery speed (160 ms), high linearity, and prominent durability (more than 850 stretching-releasing cycles under an extensive tensile deformation of 15% strain). As a result, the Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposite strain sensor demonstrates attractive prospects in precision measurements of all frequencies of human activities, including tiny mechanical deformations (facial expressions, eye activities, blood flow pulse, and vibration of the vocal cords) and large-strain human joint movements (bending process of a finger, and wrist, elbow, and knee bending), hence exhibiting substantial potential in human activity monitoring as well as biomedical engineering.

KW  - human
KW  - operating room
N2  - An extended-reality (XR) platform for real-time monitoring of patients' health during surgical procedures is proposed. The proposed system provides real-time access to a comprehensive set of patients' information, which are made promptly available to the surgical team in the operating room (OR). In particular, the XR platform supports the medical staff by automatically acquiring the patient's vitals from the operating room instrumentation and displaying them in real-time directly on an XR headset. Furthermore, information regarding the patient clinical record is also shown upon request. Finally, the XR-based monitoring platform also allows displaying in XR the video stream coming directly from the endoscope. The innovative aspect of the proposed XR-based monitoring platform lies in the comprehensiveness of the available information, in its modularity and flexibility (in terms of adaption to different sources of data), ease of use, and most importantly, in a reliable communication, which are critical requirements for the healthcare field. To validate the proposed system, experimental tests were conducted using instrumentation typically available in the operating room (i.e., a respiratory ventilator, a patient monitor for intensive care, and an endoscope). The overall results showed (i) an accuracy of the data communication greater than 99 %, along with (ii) an average time response below ms, and (iii) satisfying feedback from the SUS questionnaires filled out by the physicians after intensive use.

N2  - The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions.

N2  - Wearable and elastic pressure sensors have caused widespread concern due to the popularity of smart terminals and human health monitoring. To obtain a flexible pressure sensor with a wide detection region and outstanding sensitivity, exploring new materials and novel structures has become the first choice for the research. Here, a wearable and flexible MXene fibrous network pressure sensor (MFNS) with a high sensitivity and wide detection region is reported. The holistic fiber network is composed of pure MXene fibers; among them, MXene fibers were prepared by wet-spinning of MXene nanosheets. The MFNS exhibits a high sensitivity in a wide detection region (51 kPa-1 for 14.7 kPa and 427 kPa-1 within the 14.7-19.9 kPa range), a low detection limit (8 Pa), a robust durability (10,000 cycles), and a prompt response (95 ms). Due to the superior performance of MFNS, it also proves prospective applications for human motion signal detection (such as swallowing, pulse beat, and joint motion) and measuring pressure distribution. This work provides an effective way to fabricate a high-performance pressure sensor for human-machine interactions, personal healthcare monitoring, and multitouch devices.

N2  - Background: With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel. Objectives: The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. Methods: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. Results: Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. Conclusions: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients.

N2  - The monitoring of proximity-contact events is essential for human-machine interactions, intelligent robots, and healthcare monitoring. We report a dual-modal sensor made with two functionalized optical microfibers (MFs), which is inspired by the somatosensory system of human skin. The integrated sensor with a hierarchical structure gradationally detects finger approaching and touching by measuring the relative humidity (RH) and force-triggered light intensity variations. Specifically, the RH sensory part shows enhanced evanescent absorption, achieving a sensitive RH measurement with a fast response (110 ms), a high resolution (0.11%RH), and a wide working range (10-100%RH). Enabled by the transition from guided modes into radiation modes of the waveguiding MF, the force sensory part exhibits a high sensitivity (6.2%/kPa) and a fast response (up to 1.5 kHz). By using a real-time data processing unit, the proximity-contact sensor (PCS) achieves continuous detection of the full-contact events, including finger approaching, contacting, pressing, releasing, and leaving. As a proof of concept, the electromagnetic-interference-free PCS enables a smart switch system to recognize the proximity and contact of bare/gloved fingers. Moreover, skin humidity detection and respiration monitoring are realized. These initial results pave the way toward a category of optical collaborative devices ranging from human-machine interfaces to multifunctional on-skin healthcare sensors.

N2  - Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert’s office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients’ homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials.

N2  - Flexible pressure sensors have been studied as wearable voice-recognition devices to be utilized in human-machine interaction. However, the development of highly sensitive, skin-attachable, and comfortable sensing devices to achieve clear voice detection remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a wearable and flexible pressure and temperature sensor with a sensitive response to vibration, which can accurately recognize the human voice by combing with the artificial neural network. The device consists of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) printed with a silver electrode, a filament-microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film embedded with single-walled carbon nanotubes and a polyimide (PI) film sputtered with a patterned Ti/Pt thermistor strip. The developed pressure sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of 0.398 kPa-1 in the low-pressure regime, and the fabricated temperature sensor shows a desirable temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.13% ∘C in the range of 25 ∘C to 105 ∘C. Through training and testing the neural network model with the waveform data of the sensor obtained from human pronunciation, the vocal fold vibrations of different words can be successfully recognized, and the total recognition accuracy rate can reach 93.4%. Our results suggest that the fabricated sensor has substantial potential for application in the human-computer interface fields, such as voice control, vocal healthcare monitoring, and voice authentication.

N2  - The purposes of this pilot study are to utilize digital remote monitoring to (a) evaluate the usability and satisfaction of a wireless blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) monitor and (b) determine whether these data can enable safe mobilization at home after same-day discharge (SDD) joint replacement. A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean "ease of use" rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to safe mobilization.

N2  - The elderly is a continuous growth sector thanks to the life expectancy increase in Western society. This sector is especially at risk from the appearance of respiratory diseases and, therefore, is the most affected sector in the COVID-19 epidemic. Many of these elderly require continuous care in residences or by specialized caregivers, but these personal contacts put this sector at risk. In this work, an IoT system for elderly remote monitoring is studied, designed, developed and tested. This system is composed by a smart garment that records information from various physiological sensors in order to detect falls, sudden changes in body temperature, heart problems and heat stroke; This information is sent to a cloud server through a gateway located in the patient's residence, allowing to real-time monitor remotely patient's activity using a customized App, as well as receiving alerts in dangerous situations. This system has been tested with professional caregivers, obtaining usability and functionality surveys; and, in addition, a detailed power-consumption study has been carried out. The results, compared with other similar systems, demonstrate that the proposed one is useful, usable, works in real time and has a decent power consumption that allows the patient to carry it during all day without charging the battery.

N2  - Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. METHODS: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups. RESULTS: Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments.

N2  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. METHODS: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. RESULTS: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions.

N2  - Objectives: Gout flares are painful and disabling. We developed a smartphone application (app) for patients to tele-monitor gout flares surveyed by clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess patient acceptability and technical and clinical feasibility. Methods: Adult patients with either established gout or high suspicion thereof were recruited if they possessed a smartphone and reported a recent arthritis attack. A smartphone application was used to identify gout flares by asking during 90 consecutive days: (1) what is your pain score (0-10); (2) are your joints warm; (3) are your joints swollen; and (4) are you currently experiencing a gout flare? The clinician was alerted via email if a flare occurred. Patient acceptability was assessed using the technology acceptance model. Technical feasibility consisted of reported technical issues and clinical feasibility of actions taken by the clinician regarding gout flare alerts. Results: Twenty-nine included patients completed the study. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and all but one were male. The adherence rate was 96% (110 of 2910 queries were missed). Patients had a positive attitude toward app use, found the app very easy to use (mean usability score 81 out of 100) and were neutral to positive on its usefulness. There were four minor technical issues. A total of 100 gout flare alerts were generated that led to 18 proactive contacts with patients. Conclusion: A smartphone app to monitor gout flares was developed and tested, showing high adherence, good acceptability and clinical feasibility for established gout patients.

However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was "access to technology and systems," which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was "collecting and sharing of information," which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar "barriers to uptake": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.

N2  - Purpose: wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. Method: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0–12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results: Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. Conclusions: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a primary cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide. For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. METHODS: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. CONCLUSIONS: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care.

N2  - Background: Mobile health is a promising strategy aiming to anticipate and prevent the deterioration of health status in palliative cancer patients. A prerequisite for successful implementation of this technology into clinical routine is a high level of usability and acceptance of devices. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance of remote monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer patients. Methods: In this prospective single-center observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients treated with palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a smartphone including a pre-installed "Activity Monitoring" app and a sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12 weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We report detailed feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients' acceptance of the wearables. Results: Between February 2017 and May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included in the study. From these, 25 participants (83%) completed the whole study period. On average, the bracelet was worn on 53% and smartphone used on 85% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale) was 73%, and 28 patients were able to handle the wearables and to operate the app without major problems. Use of the bracelet was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7% of all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). Conclusions: Remote monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer patients with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able to handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet. Feedback towards use of this monitoring system was mostly positive.

N2  - Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.
