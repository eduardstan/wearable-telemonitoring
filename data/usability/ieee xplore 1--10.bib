  abstract={Wearable devices have received tremendous interest in healthcare monitoring due to their significant advantages in terms of flexibility, noninvasiveness, wireless capability, and portability. However, they still face challenges, including the need for external power sources, bulky measuring instruments, and a lack of a wireless data transport system. Herein, we propose a PEDOT:PSS/MXene pressure sensing platform based on 2-D e-textile and screen-printed interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). Both materials improve the electrical conductivity, sensitivity, stability, flexibility, and mechanical durability of the pressure sensor. A near-field communication (NFC) readout system provides real-time wireless monitoring by transmitting signals from the sensor to a smartphone app, without external batteries. The pressure sensor has sensitivity, a wide detection range, excellent repeatability and stability, fast response/recovery time, and long-term durability. Long-term usability was verified through the bending test up to 21400 cycles. The flexible pressure sensor successfully monitored wrist pulse, physical movements, and various muscle movements in the body. Repeatable, stable, reliable, and regular signals were obtained wirelessly through the NFC readout system. Our sensing platform could be a promising solution for healthcare monitoring, rehabilitation therapy, and early medical diagnosis. In addition, it suggests a new platform for helping people with disabilities to communicate with others through human–machine interaction.},

  abstract={Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

  abstract={Goal: To evaluate the usability of different technologies designed for a remote assessment of knee osteoarthritis. Methods: We recruited eleven patients affected by mild or moderate knee osteoarthritis, eleven caregivers, and eleven clinicians to assess the following technologies: a wristband for monitoring physical activity, an examination chair for measuring leg extension, a thermal camera for acquiring skin thermographic data, a force balance for measuring center of pressure, an ultrasound imaging system for remote echographic acquisition, a mobile app, and a clinical portal software. Specific questionnaires scoring usability were filled out by patients, caregivers and clinicians. Results: The questionnaires highlighted a good level of usability and user-friendliness for all the technologies, obtaining an average score of 8.7 provided by the patients, 8.8 by the caregivers, and 8.5 by the clinicians, on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. Such average scores were calculated by putting together the scores obtained for the single technologies under evaluation and averaging them. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a high level of acceptability for the tested portable technologies designed for a potentially remote and frequent assessment of knee osteoarthritis.},

  title={Design of a Multi-Sensors Wearable System for Continuous Home Monitoring of People With Parkinson’s}, 
  year={2024},

  pages={38436-38455},
  abstract={Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient’s condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson’s often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson’s disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques.},

  year={2024},
  volume={11},

  pages={22007-22020},
  abstract={The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth’s capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.},

  title={A Home Telemedicine System for Continuous Respiratory Monitoring}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={25},
  number={4},
  pages={1247-1256},
  abstract={This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.},

  abstract={This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Objective: Autonomic Dysreflexia (AD) is a potentially life-threatening syndrome which occurs in individuals with higher level spinal cord injuries (SCI). AD is caused by triggers which can lead to rapid escalation of pathophysiological responses and if the trigger is not removed, AD can be fatal. There is currently no objective, non-invasive and accurate monitoring system available to automatically detect the onset of AD symptoms in real time in a non-clinical setting. Technology or Method: We developed a user-independent method of symptomatic AD detection in real time with a wearable physiological telemetry system (PTS) and a machine learning model using data from eleven participants with SCI. Results: The PTS could detect onset of AD symptoms with an average accuracy of 94.10% and a false negative rate of 4.89%. Conclusions: The PTS can detect the onset of the symptoms AD with high sensitivity and specificity to assist people with SCIs in preventing the occurrence of AD. It would enable persons with high level SCIs to be more independent and pursue vocational activities while granting continuous medical oversight. Clinical Impact: The PTS could serve as a supplementary tool to current solutions to detect the onset of AD and prepare individuals who are newly injured to be better prepared for AD episodes. Moreover, it could be translated into a system to encourage individuals to practice better healthcare management to prevent future occurrences.},

  title={GaRuDa: A Blockchain-Based Delivery Scheme Using Drones for Healthcare 5.0 Applications}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={4},
  number={4},
  pages={60-66},
  abstract={Over the years, the healthcare industry has transformed from being hospital-centric to patient-centric. This shift is mainly due to the convergence of emergent technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT)-based healthcare, fifth generation (5G)-assisted networking, and data-driven analytics through artificial intelligence. The convergence, referred to as Healthcare 5.0, has improved healthcare services to support real-time analytics, user mobility, remote monitoring, and personalized user experience through decentralized applications. However, the medical supply chain systems and delivery operations among healthcare stakeholders suffer from limitations of harsh environmental conditions due to restricted zones, rough terrains, war-prone areas, poor road conditions, congested traffic, and remote locations. Thus, the Internet of Drones (IoD) is deployed in Healthcare 5.0 supply chains to streamline and expedite the medical delivery process through open channels (i.e. the Internet). However, the Internet is an open channel that is prone to malicious activities which can violate the privacy and confidentiality of patient data. Blockchain is a promising technology that can handle the security and reliability of drone delivery among untrusted open channels. Motivated by the aforementioned facts, we propose GaRuDa, a blockchain-based drone delivery scheme for Healthcare 5.0 applications. The proposed scheme integrates IoD and blockchain through 5G-enabled tactile Internet to facilitate low-latency responsive delivery of medical supplies that can be chronologically monitored and tracked among different stakeholders. We compared the proposed scheme with the traditional medical delivery scheme with payment gateways to demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of data storage, computation, and communication costs. The simulation results obtained show that the average transaction cost has been reduced by ≈ 44.56 percent, and 5G tactile Internet has a reduced latency of 0.051 ms compared to 18.3 ms in 4G LTE service. The average communication overheads have reduced by ≈ 67.34 percent compared to traditional 4G LTE and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing channels, which indicates the scheme's viability.},

  title={From Scalp to Ear-EEG: A Generalizable Transfer Learning Model for Automatic Sleep Scoring in Older People}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={12},
  number={},
  pages={448-456},
  abstract={Objective: Sleep monitoring has extensively utilized electroencephalogram (EEG) data collected from the scalp, yielding very large data repositories and well-trained analysis models. Yet, this wealth of data is lacking for emerging, less intrusive modalities, such as ear-EEG.Methods and procedures: The current study seeks to harness the abundance of open-source scalp EEG datasets by applying models pre-trained on data, either directly or with minimal fine-tuning; this is achieved in the context of effective sleep analysis from ear-EEG data that was recorded using a single in-ear electrode, referenced to the ipsilateral mastoid, and developed in-house as described in our previous work. Unlike previous studies, our research uniquely focuses on an older cohort (17 subjects aged 65-83, mean age 71.8 years, some with health conditions), and employs LightGBM for transfer learning, diverging from previous deep learning approaches. Results: Results show that the initial accuracy of the pre-trained model on ear-EEG was 70.1%, but fine-tuning the model with ear-EEG data improved its classification accuracy to 73.7%. The fine-tuned model exhibited a statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05, dependent t-test) for 10 out of the 13 participants, as reflected by an enhanced average Cohen’s kappa score (a statistical measure of inter-rater agreement for categorical items) of 0.639, indicating a stronger agreement between automated and expert classifications of sleep stages. Comparative SHAP value analysis revealed a shift in feature importance for the N3 sleep stage, underscoring the effectiveness of the fine-tuning process.Conclusion: Our findings underscore the potential of fine-tuning pre-trained scalp EEG models on ear-EEG data to enhance classification accuracy, particularly within an older population and using feature-based methods for transfer learning. This approach presents a promising avenue for ear-EEG analysis in sleep studies, offering new insights into the applicability of transfer learning across different populations and computational techniques.Clinical impact: An enhanced ear-EEG method could be pivotal in remote monitoring settings, allowing for continuous, non-invasive sleep quality assessment in elderly patients with conditions like dementia or sleep apnea.},
