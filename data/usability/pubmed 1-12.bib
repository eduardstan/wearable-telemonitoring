               monitoring in the general ward, increasing patient safety.
               Little is known about the experiences and expectations of
               patients and health care professionals regarding continuous
               monitoring with these devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
               identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and
               facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile
               (VM) and HealthPatch (HP). METHODS: In this randomized
               controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine
               and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands
               were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using
               VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and
               expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews.
               Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also
               interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content
               analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State
               Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The
               System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both
               devices. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician
               assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We
               identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19
               facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP.
               Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of
               clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM
               lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological
               distress and usability were found between randomization groups
               or devices. CONCLUSIONS: Both devices were well received by most
               patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them
               encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in
               the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and
               facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for
               future researchers, developers, and health care institutions
               that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward.

               measure symptoms and treatment effects in people with
               Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home environment. However,
               information about user experience and long-term compliance of
               such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD
               symptoms is lacking. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to gain insight into
               user experience and long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be
               worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to report falls and receive
               feedback of data. METHODS: We analyzed the data of the
               ``Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home'' study, a 1-year
               observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User
               experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were
               described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify
               determinants of 1-year compliance. RESULTS: We included 200 PwP
               (mean age: 69 years, 37\% women), of whom 116 (58\%) completed
               the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study
               were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of
               the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by
               77\% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession,
               shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and
               less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and
               gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year
               compliance. CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year compliance with this
               specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was
               generally good, except battery life and data transfer. Future
               studies can build on these findings by incorporating a
               smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues.",

               (SPHYNCS) is a multicenter research initiative to identify new
               biomarkers in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH).
               Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH
               disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized
               Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate,
               and sleep parameters over 1 year. We examined the feasibility of
               long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We
               then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with
               NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants
               received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a adherence metric to
               evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an
               overall adherence rate of 80\% over 1 year. We calculated daily
               physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from 2 weeks
               of greatest adherence to compare NT1 (n = 20) and HC (n = 9)
               participants. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated
               findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation,
               including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p =
               .007) and awakening index (p = .025), as well as standard
               deviation of time in bed (p = .044). Moreover, NT1 patients
               exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p = .019), and
               sleep latency (p = .001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p
               = .008), heart rate standard deviation (p = .039) and
               high-intensity activity (p = .009) compared to HC. This ongoing
               study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with
               wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially
               identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further
               validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that
               long-term wearable technology may play a future role in
               diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.",

              clinical decompensation and preventing hospitalization. Direct
              left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer theoretical benefits beyond
              pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We evaluated the
              safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial
              pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. METHODS AND
              RESULTS: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human,
              prospective, multicentre, single-arm, clinical trial enrolling 30
              patients with HF. The device consisted of an interatrial
              positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly.
              After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to
              correlate mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with
              simultaneous mean LAP obtained from the device. Remote LAP
              measurements were then used to guide patient management. The
              miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30
              patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological
              events (MACNE). At 3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was
              97\%. Agreement between sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was
              consistent, with a mean difference of -0.22 $\pm$ 4.92 mmHg, the
              correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance correlation
              coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776

              experience with V-LAP-based HF management was associated with
              significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
              functional class (32\% of patients reached NYHA class II at 6
              months, p < 0.005; 60\% of patients at 12 months, p < 0.005) and

               management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk
               factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient
               monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully
               integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric
               design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to
               conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable,
               interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous
               feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable
               (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate
               factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. METHODS:
               The RPM system requirements were established through focus group
               sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and
               implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical
               feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility,
               the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective
               randomized interventional study focusing on dilated
               cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12
               months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability
               from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an
               evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction
               frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data
               classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and
               patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive
               statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear
               regression with 95\% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the
               influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group
               membership. RESULTS: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable
               components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a
               notification service. The system was evaluated with 95
               consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29\%
               female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study
               protocol. The system's app achieved a mean System Usability
               Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device
               experience. In total, 87\% (83/95) of the patients could
               integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily
               routine, and 71\% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for
               management of their health condition. On average, patients
               interacted with the wearable on 61\% (SD 26\%) of days enrolled
               in the study. SHD were available on average for 78\% (SD 23\%)
               of days, and PROM data were available on 64\% (SD 27\%) of weeks
               enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and
               PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group
               membership. CONCLUSIONS: Our results mark a first step toward
               integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for
               primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They
               can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable,

               step counts and the daily step counts reported by their
               smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of
               smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: This prospective
               observational study was conducted among patients undergoing
               lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as
               control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks
               before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data
               collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The
               participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn
               24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of
               daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We
               compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time
               series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in
               different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to
               estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts
               and the characteristics of the patients as independent
               variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the
               participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA
               tracker. RESULTS: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from
               21 patients (n=11, 52\% female patients) and 10 nonpatients
               (n=6, 60\% female patients). The median cross-correlation
               coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The
               correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than
               that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median
               0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests

               the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA
               tracker's total number of steps ($\chi$21=34.7, P<.001). In
               addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was
               78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA
               tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and
               practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the
               smartphones and the total daily step count time series
               highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting
               changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a
               patient's PA.",

              biomarkers. Here, we report on the analytical validation for
              heart rate, heart rate variability and respiration rate. Study

              during a 30-minute exercise protocol involving rest, squats,
              slow, and fast cycling. The Shimmer3 ECG Unit and Cosmed K5, were

              rate and marginal agreement in respiratory rate, with lower
              agreement towards higher respiratory rates. The Lin's concordance
              coefficient was 0.98 for heart rate and 0.56 for respiratory

              has become increasingly relevant in many situations.
              Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home
              monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory
              home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19
              vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and
              smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms
              will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and
              acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of
              wearable devices, including home spirometry and a
              smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital
              sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and
              second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods:
              Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home
              monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week
              after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by
              recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature,
              pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional
              measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of
              monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their
              perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a
              purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to
              receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the
              intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs
              and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events
              reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and
              headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5-8 days
              post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was
              high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to
              continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed
              favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs
              during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of
              the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment
              uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors),

               in addition to conventional parameters, may enhance the efficacy
               of noninvasive telemonitoring for heart failure (HF). We sought
               to assess the feasibility of self-telemonitoring with multiple
               devices including a handheld heart sound recorder and its
               association with clinical events in patients with HF. METHODS:
               Ambulatory HF patients recorded their own heart sounds,
               mono‑lead electrocardiograms, oxygen saturation, body weight,
               and vital signs using multiple devices every morning for six
               months. RESULTS: In the 77 patients enrolled (63 $\pm$ 13 years
               old, 84 \% male), daily measurements were feasible with a
               self-measurement rate of >70 \% of days in 75 \% of patients.
               Younger age and higher Minnesota Living with Heart Failure
               Questionnaire scores were independently associated with lower
               adherence (p = 0.002 and 0.027, respectively). A usability
               questionnaire showed that 87 \% of patients felt
               self-telemonitoring was helpful, and 96 \% could use the devices
               without routine cohabitant support. Six patients experienced ten
               HF events of re-hospitalization and/or unplanned hospital visits
               due to HF. In patients who experienced HF events, a significant
               increase in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure and a
               decrease in the time interval from Q wave onset to the second
               heart sound were observed 7 days before the events compared with

               anticipate and prevent the deterioration of health status in
               palliative cancer patients. A prerequisite for successful
               implementation of this technology into clinical routine is a

               We aimed to evaluate feasibility as well as patients' acceptance
               of remote monitoring using wearables in palliative cancer
               patients. METHODS: In this prospective single-center
               observational feasibility study, 30 cancer patients treated with
               palliative intent in an inpatient setting with an estimated life
               expectancy of >8 weeks and <12 months were provided with a
               smartphone including a pre-installed ``Activity Monitoring'' app
               and a sensor-equipped bracelet and monitored over a period of 12
               weeks starting at discharge from hospital. We report detailed
               feasibility and usability aspects and comment on patients'
               acceptance of the wearables. RESULTS: Between February 2017 and
               May 2018 a total of 30 patients were included in the study. From
               these, 25 participants (83\%) completed the whole study period.
               On average, the bracelet was worn on 53\% and smartphone used on
               85\% of the study days. The completion rate of daily digital
               questionnaires for subjective ratings (pain and distress scale)
               was 73\%, and 28 patients were able to handle the wearables and
               to operate the app without major problems. Use of the bracelet
               was low during the night hours, with a wearing time of 1.7\% of
               all night hours (8 p.m. to 8 a.m.). CONCLUSIONS: Remote
               monitoring of health care status in palliative cancer patients
               with a limited life expectancy is feasible and patients are able
               to handle the smartphone and the sensor-equipped bracelet.

               wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking
               speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream
               consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often
               inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment.
               OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an
               instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device
               monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active
               walking from shuffling after step length calibration. METHODS: A
               multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were
               evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were
               evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized
               trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A
               qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone
               semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that
               this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor
               and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants'
               acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and
               average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome
               described physical frailty evolution in both groups. RESULTS:
               Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase
               design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed
               insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results:
               low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for
               usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised
               no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of
               participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite
               satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the
               follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows:
               63\% (12/19) at 1 month, 50\% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75\%
               (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the
               intervention group discontinued the intervention because of
               technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week
               reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83\% (15/18)
               at 2 months, and 94\% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1
               hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that
               participants effectively wore the insole without significant
               decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4
               months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the
               change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ
               for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared
               to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports acceptability data
               on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with
               remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life
               conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population
               set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery,
               was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable
               solution over time that is valued by participants. However,
               users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the
               growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results
               will be useful for future developments. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
