   abstract = {In the last months, the market for personal wearable devices has been booming significantly, and, in particular, smartwatches are starting to assume a fundamental role in the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) arena as well as in the more general Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, by acting both as sensitive data sources and as user identity proxies. These new roles, complementing the more traditional personal assistance and telemetry/tracking ones, open new perspectives in their integration in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures such as e-payment, health care monitoring, and emergency systems, as well as in their usage as remote control facilities in smart services. Users can access their IoT devices at any time from any place through smartwatches. We argue that this new scenario calls for a strengthened and more resilient authentication of users on these devices, despite their limitations in terms of dimensions and hardware constraints that may considerably affect the usability of security mechanisms. In this article, we present an innovative authentication scheme targeted at smartwatches, namely CirclePIN, that provides both resilience to most common attacks and a high level of usability in tests with real users. © 2020 ACM.},

   abstract = {Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼−0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints. © 2023 American Chemical Society},

The whole process is a complete solution process that facilitates large-area preparation and application. The light-weight hybrid electrodes exhibit high optical transmittance, high electrical conductivity, and high gas/ion permeability.

   abstract = {The monitoring of proximity-contact events is essential for human-machine interactions, intelligent robots, and healthcare monitoring. We report a dual-modal sensor made with two functionalized optical microfibers (MFs), which is inspired by the somatosensory system of human skin. The integrated sensor with a hierarchical structure gradationally detects finger approaching and touching by measuring the relative humidity (RH) and force-triggered light intensity variations. Specifically, the RH sensory part shows enhanced evanescent absorption, achieving a sensitive RH measurement with a fast response (110 ms), a high resolution (0.11%RH), and a wide working range (10-100%RH). Enabled by the transition from guided modes into radiation modes of the waveguiding MF, the force sensory part exhibits a high sensitivity (6.2%/kPa) and a fast response (up to 1.5 kHz). By using a real-time data processing unit, the proximity-contact sensor (PCS) achieves continuous detection of the full-contact events, including finger approaching, contacting, pressing, releasing, and leaving. As a proof of concept, the electromagnetic-interference-free PCS enables a smart switch system to recognize the proximity and contact of bare/gloved fingers. Moreover, skin humidity detection and respiration monitoring are realized. These initial results pave the way toward a category of optical collaborative devices ranging from human-machine interfaces to multifunctional on-skin healthcare sensors. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Herein, we present a self-powered, antislip, and multifunctional smart outsole based on the gecko toe-inspired tilted magnetized flakes (TMFs) and underlying flexible coils. With the pressure-induced flake deflection and the built-in magnetic moment alignment, the TMF can produce a variable magnetic field to induce the voltage signals in coils for precise pressure perception and linear velocity sensing. The TMF-based smart outsole can thus serve as a real-time footwear recorder to monitor various body actions for exercise analysis and to track the abnormal landing speed for alerting potential injuries. The gecko toe-like flakes also enable the excellent antislip capability of the outsole with a much higher friction coefficient than the standard one of the low slip risk. By programming the magnetic moment alignments of the TMFs, a single-circuit outsole can further output multiple signals as encoded instructions for controlling the racing game. Along with excellent abrasion resistance and environmental immunity, the proposed outsole exhibits great potential as a convenient platform for reliable healthcare monitoring and efficient HMI. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing.

   abstract = {Wearable sensors have recently attracted extensive interest not only in the field of healthcare monitoring but also for convenient and intelligent human-machine interactions. However, challenges such as wearable comfort, multiple applicable conditions, and differentiation of mechanical stimuli are yet to be fully addressed. Herein, we developed a breathable and waterproof electronic skin (E-skin) that can perceive pressure/strain with nonoverlapping signals. The synergistic effect from magnetic attraction and nanoscaled aggregation renders the E-skin with microscaled pores for breathability and three-dimensional microcilia for superhydrophobicity. Upon applied pressure, the bending of conductive microcilia enables sufficient contacts for resistance decrease, while the stretching causes increased resistance due to the separation of conductive materials. The optimized E-skin exhibits a high gauge factor of 7.747 for small strain (0-80%) and a detection limit down to 0.04%. The three-dimensional microcilia also exhibit a sensitivity of -0.0198 kPa-1(0-3 kPa) and a broad detection range up to 200 kPa with robustness. The E-skin can reliably and precisely distinguish kinds of the human joint motions, covering a broad spectrum including bending, stretching, and pressure. With the nonoverlapping readouts, ternary inputs "1", "0", and "-1" could be produced with different stimuli, which expands the command capacity for logic outputs such as effective Morse code and intuitive robotic control. Owing to the rapid response, long-term stability (10 »000 cycles), breathability, and superhydrophobicity, we believe that the E-skin can be widely applied as wearable devices from body motion monitoring to human-machine interactions toward a more convenient and intelligent future. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time.

   abstract = {Wearable and flexible capacitive pressure sensors have recently attracted significant attention in the fields of healthcare monitoring and intelligent human-machine interaction. While considerable progress is made in achieving high-pressure resolution over a wide linearity range, practical implementation still faces significant challenges due to complex manufacturing processes, as well as limited accuracy and stability for information transmission. To address these issues, inspiration is drawn from human skin and develop a new hybrid dielectric comprising a low-permittivity (low-k) micro-cilia array and a high-permittivity (high-k) foam. Without assistance from an elaborate fabrication methodology, the template-free method provides a cost-effective and convenient way to realize the functional dielectric for flexible capacitive sensors. The hybrid dielectric exhibits a pressure-induced series-parallel conversion mechanism, enabling effective manipulation of the linear effective dielectric constant and controlled initial/resultant capacitance. Through systematic optimization, the sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity of 0.236 kPa−1 within an ultrabroad linearity range of up to 1100 kPa. Thanks to the unique characteristics of the hybrid dielectric, this device showcases potential applications in various domains including human joint motion analysis, healthcare monitoring, accurate message transmission, and convenient Morse code communication utilizing non-overlapping capacitance signals. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

Herein, bioinspired by the highly sensitive human skin microstructure (protective epidermis/spinous sensing structure/nerve conduction network), a skin bionic multifunctional electronics is prepared by face-to-face assembly of a newly prepared healable, recyclable, and antibacterial polyurethane elastomer matrix with conductive MXene nanosheets-coated microdome array after ingenious templating method as protective epidermis layer/sensing layer, and an interdigitated electrode as signal transmission layer. The polyurethane elastomer matrix functionalized with triple dynamic bonds (reversible hydrogen bonds, oxime carbamate bonds, and copper (II) ion coordination bonds) is newly prepared, demonstrating excellent healability with highly healing efficiency, robust recyclability, and reliable antibacterial capability, as well as good biocompatibility. Benefiting from the superior mechanical performance of the polyurethane elastomer matrix and the unique skin bionic microstructure of the sensor, the as-assembled flexible electronics exhibit admirable sensing performances featuring ultrahigh sensitivity (up to 1573.05 kPa−1), broad sensing range (up to 325 kPa), good reproducibility, the fast response time (≈4 ms), and low detection limit (≈0.98 Pa) in diagnostic human healthcare monitoring, excellent healability, and reliable antibacterial performance. © 2023 The Authors.

However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation. This ultrasensitive flexible sensor provides a platform capable of sensing and responding to external magnetic fields and will find applications in soft robotics, wearable healthcare monitoring, and consumer electronics.  © 2021 Author(s).},

In this work, an IoT system for elderly remote monitoring is studied, designed, developed and tested. This system is composed by a smart garment that records information from various physiological sensors in order to detect falls, sudden changes in body temperature, heart problems and heat stroke; This information is sent to a cloud server through a gateway located in the patient's residence, allowing to real-time monitor remotely patient's activity using a customized App, as well as receiving alerts in dangerous situations. This system has been tested with professional caregivers, obtaining usability and functionality surveys; and, in addition, a detailed power-consumption study has been carried out. The results, compared with other similar systems, demonstrate that the proposed one is useful, usable, works in real time and has a decent power consumption that allows the patient to carry it during all day without charging the battery.},

Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes.},

   abstract = {Monitoring the physiological signals of people by using wearable sensors attached to the skin while they go about their daily routine is a practical approach to prevent diseases and monitor people’s health status. However, conventional monitoring devices are bulky, their signals are corrupted by the noise generated by external sources, and they are prone to mechanical failure, which hinder their practical use. Herein, a mechanically durable biomaterial-based arterial pulse thin-film sensor is developed for real-time monitoring of cyclic physiological signals. A hierarchical layered material (rGO/SF/CNC) comprising reduced graphene oxide (rGO), silk fibroin (SF), and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is fabricated using the spin-assisted layer-by-layer (SA-LbL) technique and thermal reduction. Thermal reduction is performed to tailor the defects in rGO, which significantly enhances its mechanical robustness and bending properties, as well as in-plane stress sensitivity, owing to a change in conductivity. The thin-film (thickness: 40.9 nm) sensor has a rapid response time (69 ms) and excellent durability exceeding 8000 cycles. Moreover, it is insensitive to strain in the orthogonal direction, which significantly reduces the noise level and dramatically increases its sensitivity. The sensor’s suitability for practical use as an arterial pulse sensor for monitoring physiological signals is demonstrated. The developed thin-film flexible stress sensor has the potential to contribute toward the improvement of wearable healthcare monitoring devices and human–machine interaction.

   abstract = {AIMS: In heart failure (HF), implantable haemodynamic monitoring
devices have been shown to optimize therapy, anticipating
clinical decompensation and preventing hospitalization. Direct
left-sided haemodynamic sensors offer theoretical benefits beyond
pulmonary artery pressure monitoring systems. We evaluated the
safety, usability, and performance of a novel left atrial
pressure (LAP) monitoring system in HF patients. METHODS AND
RESULTS: The VECTOR-HF study (NCT03775161) was a first-in-human,
prospective, multicentre, single-arm, clinical trial enrolling 30
patients with HF. The device consisted of an interatrial
positioned leadless sensor, able to transmit LAP data wirelessly.
After 3 months, a right heart catheterization was performed to
correlate mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) with
simultaneous mean LAP obtained from the device. Remote LAP
measurements were then used to guide patient management. The
miniaturized device was successfully implanted in all 30
patients, without acute major adverse cardiac and neurological
events (MACNE). At 3 months, freedom from short-term MACNE was
97%. Agreement between sensor-calculated LAP and PCWP was
consistent, with a mean difference of -0.22  4.92 mmHg, the
correlation coefficient and the Lin's concordance correlation
coefficient values were equal to 0.79 (p < 0.0001) and 0.776
(95% confidence interval 0.582-0.886), respectively. Preliminary
experience with V-LAP-based HF management was associated with
significant improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA)
functional class (32% of patients reached NYHA class II at 6
months, p < 0.005; 60% of patients at 12 months, p < 0.005) and
6-min walk test distance (from 244.59  119.59 m at baseline
to 311.78  129.88 m after 6 months, p < 0.05, and 343.95
146.15 m after 12 months, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The V-LAP™
monitoring system proved to be generally safe and provided a good
correlation with invasive PCWP. Initial evidence also suggests
possible improvement in HF clinical symptoms.},

   abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient's condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson's often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson's disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson's disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques. © 2013 IEEE.},

The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

   abstract = {Background: With the spread of COVID-19, telemedicine solutions became crucial to release continuous and remote assistance to chronic patients. The rapid transition to telemedicine solutions did not allow a complete assessment of the user experience by both patients and medical personnel. Despite the well-known benefits in remote care, the lack of usability evaluation of already existing technologies for the vital signs measurement has emerged. A telemedicine platform must match video communication between patients and the medical staff with the possibility to measure vital parameters. Furthermore, technological assistance may overcome the unfamiliarity with telemedicine and drastically reduce the learning time for both patients and medical personnel. Objectives: The research work presents a method to improve the user experience of a telemedicine service based on the combination of televisits and telemonitoring with wearable sensors for heart failure patients. Skilled technological staff is proposed by the presented method to lead the learning process of both medical personnel and patients in order to reach a high level of usability in less than 6 months. Methods: The proposed method is composed of 5 steps: identification of technological staff and end users; selection of the telemedicine platform; design of questionnaires for usability analysis; training of clinicians and patients; final usability evaluation of the telemedicine platform by means of customized satisfaction questionnaires and Post-Study System Usability Questionnaires (PSSUQs). The methodological approach has been tested in collaboration with a heart failure clinic by involving 5 physicians, 5 nurses, 15 heart failure patients, a research engineer and 4 technicians. A platform with 3 wearable sensors has been chosen: a wireless thermometer, a finger pulse-oximeter and an undershirt have been used for the detection of ECG trace. While these devices allowed asynchronous measurements of physiological data, scheduled televisits have been used for direct communication between physicians and patients. Results: Satisfaction questionnaires of patients and clinicians reached respectively 65.18% and 65.83%, while PSSUQ scores were respectively 91.73% and 81.70%. Both groups of end users confirmed a good level of usability and their satisfaction about the ease of use and the perceived quality of the instrumentation. Moreover, 73% of patients did not require help from caregivers to use the kit of sensors. The results have been reached in 5.5 months according to the aim defined initially. Research engineers have played a crucial role in helping clinicians and patients to improve the user experience with the telemedicine platform. Conclusions: The high level of usability and satisfaction confirmed that the proposed methodological approach helps to learn the technological features of the telemedicine platforms, which are based on different types of technology, such as web applications, wearable sensors and virtual calls. The positive results with heart failure patients encouraged to plan further research studies by using the designed method with other categories of chronic patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Wearable devices can be used for continuous patient
monitoring in the general ward, increasing patient safety.
Little is known about the experiences and expectations of
patients and health care professionals regarding continuous
monitoring with these devices. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
identify positive and negative effects as well as barriers and
facilitators for the use of two wearable devices: ViSi Mobile
(VM) and HealthPatch (HP). METHODS: In this randomized
controlled trial, 90 patients admitted to the internal medicine
and surgical wards of a university hospital in the Netherlands
were randomly assigned to continuous vital sign monitoring using
VM or HP and a control group. Users' experiences and
expectations were addressed using semistructured interviews.
Nurses, physician assistants, and medical doctors were also
interviewed. Interviews were analyzed using thematic content
analysis. Psychological distress was assessed using the State
Trait Anxiety Inventory and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The
System Usability Scale was used to assess the usability of both
devices. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients, 20 nurses, 3 physician
assistants, and 6 medical doctors were interviewed. We
identified 47 positive and 30 negative effects and 19
facilitators and 36 barriers for the use of VM and HP.
Frequently mentioned topics included earlier identification of
clinical deterioration, increased feelings of safety, and VM
lines and electrodes. No differences related to psychological
distress and usability were found between randomization groups
or devices. CONCLUSIONS: Both devices were well received by most
patients and health care professionals, and the majority of them
encouraged the idea of monitoring vital signs continuously in
the general ward. This comprehensive overview of barriers and
facilitators of using wireless devices may serve as a guide for
future researchers, developers, and health care institutions
that consider implementing continuous monitoring in the ward.

   abstract = {Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. Methods: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. Results: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. Conclusions: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions. © Danbi Gwon, Hakyung Cho, Hangsik Shin.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. METHODS: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was "access to technology and systems," which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was "collecting and sharing of information," which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar "barriers to uptake": cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required.},

   abstract = {Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a primary cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide. For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. Objective: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. Methods: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. Results: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. Conclusions: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care. © Karin Rolanda Jongsma, Josephus F M van den Heuvel, Jasmijn Rake, Annelien L Bredenoord, Mireille N Bekker.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Technological advances allow for recording and
sharing health-related data in a patient-centric way using
smartphones and wearables. Secure sharing of such
patient-generated data with physicians would enable close
management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk
factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient
monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully
integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric
design. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to
conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable,
interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous
feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable
(Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate
factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. METHODS:
The RPM system requirements were established through focus group
sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and
implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical
feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility,
the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective
randomized interventional study focusing on dilated
cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12
months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability
from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an
evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction
frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data
classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and
patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive
statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear
regression with 95% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the
influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group
membership. RESULTS: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable
components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a
notification service. The system was evaluated with 95
consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29%
female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study
protocol. The system's app achieved a mean System Usability
Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device
experience. In total, 87% (83/95) of the patients could
integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily
routine, and 71% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for
management of their health condition. On average, patients
interacted with the wearable on 61% (SD 26%) of days enrolled
in the study. SHD were available on average for 78% (SD 23%)
of days, and PROM data were available on 64% (SD 27%) of weeks
enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and
PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group
membership. CONCLUSIONS: Our results mark a first step toward
integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for
primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They
can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable,
interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into
patients' daily routines.},

role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine
needs to be adequately explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to
explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily
step counts and the daily step counts reported by their
smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of
smartphones for collecting PA data. METHODS: This prospective
observational study was conducted among patients undergoing
lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as
control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks
before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data
collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The
participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn
24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of
daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We
compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time
series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in
different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to
estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts
and the characteristics of the patients as independent
variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the
participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA
tracker. RESULTS: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from
21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients
(n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation
coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The
correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than
that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median
0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests
on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that
the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA
tracker's total number of steps (χ21=34.7, P<.001). In
addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was
78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA
tracker. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and
practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the
smartphones and the total daily step count time series
highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting
changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a
patient's PA.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent World Health Organization reports propose
wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking
speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream
consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often
inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment.
OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an
instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device
monitors participants' walking speed and differentiates active
walking from shuffling after step length calibration. METHODS: A
multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were
evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were
evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized
trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A
qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone
semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that
this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor
and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants'
acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and
average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome
described physical frailty evolution in both groups. RESULTS:
Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase
design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed
insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results:
low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for
usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised
no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of
participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite
satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the
follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows:
63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75%
(12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the
intervention group discontinued the intervention because of
technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week
reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18)
at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1
hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that
participants effectively wore the insole without significant
decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4
months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the
change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ
for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared
to usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports acceptability data
on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with
remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life
conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population
set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery,
was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable
solution over time that is valued by participants. However,
users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the
growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results
will be useful for future developments. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics. © 2022},

To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. Methods: This article presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and efficient PBH monitoring. Results: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of clinically meaningful data. Conclusions: By leveraging IMPACT’s existing features and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, and trial customization for PBH research. The platform’s high usability underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest. © 2023 Diabetes Technology Society.},

   abstract = {Due to their excellent mechanical properties and high tensile strain sensitivity, conductive hydrogels show great potential applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction. The integration of reliable resilience, excellent viscosity and high strain sensitivity is a great challenge for conductive hydrogels. Here, inspired by human skin with a layered structure, glycerol was first introduced into a dual-network structure to prepare a hydrogel with hydrogen bonds, endowing the hydrogels with high resilience and adhesion. A mixture of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes was sprayed on the hydrogel as a conductive layer to achieve high strain sensing. Then, a hydrogel with good toughness and high resilience was prepared by in situ polymerization as an elastic layer. Benefitting from its unique crack response mechanism, the integrated sensor showed high sensitivity (gauge factor = 20). Additionally, it presented a wide strain range (0-300%), super adhesion (56.9 N m−1) to pigskin with similar elastic modulus to the human body, and low hysteresis. This study provides a feasible solution for the improvement of wearable electronic devices for healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

   abstract = {Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring. ©Andrea Torres-Robles, Karen Allison, Simon K Poon, Miranda Shaw, Owen Hutchings, Warwick J Britton, Andrew Wilson, Melissa Baysari.},

outside of the hospital setting hinges on addressing three
crucial unmet needs: longer-term wear, skin comfort and signal
quality. Earlier, we developed a Health Patch research platform
that uses self-adhesive dry electrodes to measure vital digital
biomarkers. Here, we report on the analytical validation for
heart rate, heart rate variability and respiration rate. Study
design included n = 25 adult participants with data acquisition
during a 30-minute exercise protocol involving rest, squats,
slow, and fast cycling. The Shimmer3 ECG Unit and Cosmed K5, were
reference devices. Data analysis showed good agreement in heart
rate and marginal agreement in respiratory rate, with lower
agreement towards higher respiratory rates. The Lin's concordance
coefficient was 0.98 for heart rate and 0.56 for respiratory
rate. Heart rate variability (RMSSD) had a coefficient of 0.85.
Participants generally expressed a positive experience with the
technology, with some minor irritation from the medical adhesive.
The results highlighted potential of this technology for
short-to-medium term clinical use for cardiorespiratory health,
due to its reliability, accuracy, and compact design. Such
technology could become instrumental for remote monitoring
providing healthcare professionals with continuous data, remote
assessment and enhancing patient outcomes in cardiorespiratory

   abstract = {The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human-computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype-iShU-achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions.},

A population of 23 SDD patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA), total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or total hip arthroplasty (THA) were given a cellular BP/HR monitor, with real-time data capture. Patients took three readings after surgery, observing for specific blood pressure decreases, HR increases, or hypotensive symptoms. If any criteria applied, patients followed a hydration protocol and delayed ambulation. Home coaching was also provided to each patient. Patient experience was surveyed, and responses were assessed using descriptive statistics. Of 18 patients discharged (78%), 17 returned surveys, of which 100% reported successful device operation. The mean "ease of use" rating was 8.9/10; satisfaction with home coaching was 9.7/10; and belief that the protocol improved patient safety was 8.4/10. A total of 27.8% (n = 5) had hypotensive readings and appropriately delayed ambulation. Our pilot findings support the feasibility of and confirm the satisfaction with remote monitoring after SDD arthroplasty. All patients with symptoms of hypotension were successfully remotely managed using a standardized hydration protocol prior to safe mobilization.},

   abstract = {The Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study
(SPHYNCS) is a multicenter research initiative to identify new
biomarkers in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH).
Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH
disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized
Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate,
and sleep parameters over 1 year. We examined the feasibility of
long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We
then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with
NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants
received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a adherence metric to
evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an
overall adherence rate of 80% over 1 year. We calculated daily
physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from 2 weeks
of greatest adherence to compare NT1 (n = 20) and HC (n = 9)
participants. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated
findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation,
including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p =
.007) and awakening index (p = .025), as well as standard
deviation of time in bed (p = .044). Moreover, NT1 patients
exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p = .019), and
sleep latency (p = .001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p
= .008), heart rate standard deviation (p = .039) and
high-intensity activity (p = .009) compared to HC. This ongoing
study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with
wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially
identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further
validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that
long-term wearable technology may play a future role in
diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.},
