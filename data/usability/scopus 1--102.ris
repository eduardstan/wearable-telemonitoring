AB  - Background: Patients admitted to general wards are inherently at risk of deterioration. Thus, tools that can provide early detection of deterioration may be lifesaving. Frequent remote patient monitoring (RPM) has the potential to allow such early detection, leading to a timely intervention by health care providers. Objective: This study aimed to assess the potential of a novel wearable RPM device to provide timely alerts in patients at high risk for deterioration. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in two general wards of a large tertiary medical center. Patients determined to be at high risk to deteriorate upon admission and assigned to a telemetry bed were included. On top of the standard monitoring equipment, a wearable monitor was attached to each patient, and monitoring was conducted in parallel. The data gathered by the wearable monitors were analyzed retrospectively, with the medical staff being blinded to them in real time. Several early warning scores of the risk for deterioration were used, all calculated from frequent data collected by the wearable RPM device: these included (1) the National Early Warning Score (NEWS), (2) Airway, Breathing, Circulation, Neurology, and Other (ABCNO) score, and (3) deterioration criteria defined by the clinical team as a “wish list” score. In all three systems, the risk scores were calculated every 5 minutes using the data frequently collected by the wearable RPM device. Data generated by the early warning scores were compared with those obtained from the clinical records of actual deterioration among these patients. Results: In total, 410 patients were recruited and 217 were included in the final analysis. The median age was 71 (IQR 62-78) years and 130 (59.9%) of them were male. Actual clinical deterioration occurred in 24 patients. The NEWS indicated high alert in 16 of these 24 (67%) patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 29 hours on average. The ABCNO score indicated high alert in 18 (75%) of these patients, preceding actual clinical deterioration by 38 hours on average. Early warning based on wish list scoring criteria was observed for all 24 patients 40 hours on average before clinical deterioration was detected by the medical staff. Importantly, early warning based on the wish list scoring criteria was also observed among all other patients who did not deteriorate. Conclusions: Frequent remote patient monitoring has the potential for early detection of a high risk to deteriorate among hospitalized patients, using both grouped signal-based scores and algorithm-based prediction. In this study, we show the ability to formulate scores for early warning by using RPM. Nevertheless, early warning scores compiled on the basis of these data failed to deliver reasonable specificity. Further efforts should be directed at improving the specificity and sensitivity of such tools. © Edward Itelman, Gadi Shlomai, Avshalom Leibowitz, Shiri Weinstein, Maya Yakir, Idan Tamir, Michal Sagiv, Aia Muhsen, Maxim Perelman, Daniella Kant, Eyal Zilber, Gad Segal.

AB  - Intelligent sensors have attracted substantial attention for various applications, including wearable electronics, artificial intelligence, healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. However, there still remains a critical challenge in developing a multifunctional sensing system for complex signal detection and analysis in practical applications. Here, we develop a machine learning-combined flexible sensor for real-time tactile sensing and voice recognition through laser-induced graphitization. The intelligent sensor with a triboelectric layer can convert local pressure to an electrical signal through a contact electrification effect without external bias, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to various mechanical stimuli. With the special patterning design, a smart human-machine interaction controlling system composed of a digital arrayed touch panel is constructed to control electronic devices. Based on machine learning, the real-time monitoring and recognition of the changes of voice are achieved with high accuracy. The machine learning-empowered flexible sensor provides a promising platform for the development of flexible tactile sensing, real-time health detection, human-machine interaction, and intelligent wearable devices. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - With the development of human-machine interactions, human healthcare monitoring and Internet of Things, it is of vital importance to explore revolutionary fabrication methods to provide sustainable and flexible energy harvesters for massive personnel information. In this work, we developed the micro-topping structures enhanced triboelectric nanogenerator (MT-TENG) via unique jet printing method with the advantages of high precision, high efficiency and excellent uniformity. Regular micro-topping structure array could be tuned conveniently and rapidly through adjusting the ink properties, printing parameters and substrate characteristics in jet printing process. The results show that with micro-topping structures, TENG has high specific surface for contact electrification. MT-TENG can be applied in the real-time monitoring and self-powered sensing of body physiological signal and human joint movement. This work provides a previously unexplored strategy for shortening individual design cycle and promoting the practicality of TENG in mass manufacturing, and also possess a potential application of wearable electronics and healthcare monitoring system. © 2023

AB  - Successful implementation of remote monitoring of vital signs outside of the hospital setting hinges on addressing three crucial unmet needs: longer-term wear, skin comfort and signal quality. Earlier, we developed a Health Patch research platform that uses self-adhesive dry electrodes to measure vital digital biomarkers. Here, we report on the analytical validation for heart rate, heart rate variability and respiration rate. Study design included n = 25 adult participants with data acquisition during a 30-minute exercise protocol involving rest, squats, slow, and fast cycling. The Shimmer3 ECG Unit and Cosmed K5, were reference devices. Data analysis showed good agreement in heart rate and marginal agreement in respiratory rate, with lower agreement towards higher respiratory rates. The Lin’s concordance coefficient was 0.98 for heart rate and 0.56 for respiratory rate. Heart rate variability (RMSSD) had a coefficient of 0.85. Participants generally expressed a positive experience with the technology, with some minor irritation from the medical adhesive. The results highlighted potential of this technology for short-to-medium term clinical use for cardiorespiratory health, due to its reliability, accuracy, and compact design. Such technology could become instrumental for remote monitoring providing healthcare professionals with continuous data, remote assessment and enhancing patient outcomes in cardiorespiratory health management. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, novel digital health technologies have the potential to improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, improve care delivery, and produce better health outcomes. The National Institutes of Health called on digital health leaders to contribute to a high-quality data repository that will support researchers to make discoveries that are otherwise not possible with small, limited data sets. Objective: To this end, we seek to develop a COVID-19 digital biomarker for early detection of physiological exacerbation or decompensation. We propose the development and validation of a COVID-19 decompensation Index (CDI) in a 2-phase study that builds on existing wearable biosensor-derived analytics generated by physIQ's end-to-end cloud platform for continuous physiological monitoring with wearable biosensors. This effort serves to achieve two primary objectives: (1) to collect adequate data to help develop the CDI and (2) to collect rich deidentified clinical data correlating with outcomes and symptoms related to COVID-19 progression. Our secondary objectives include evaluation of the feasibility and usability of pinpointIQ, a digital platform through which data are gathered, analyzed, and displayed. Methods: This is a prospective, nonrandomized, open-label, 2-phase study. Phase I will involve data collection for the digital data hub of the National Institutes of Health as well as data to support the preliminary development of the CDI. Phase II will involve data collection for the hub and contribute to continued refinement and validation of the CDI. While this study will focus on the development of a CDI, the digital platform will also be evaluated for feasibility and usability while clinicians deliver care to continuously monitored patients enrolled in the study. Results: Our target CDI will be a binary classifier trained to distinguish participants with and those without decompensation. The primary performance metric for CDI will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve with a minimum performance criterion of ≥0.75 (α=.05; power [1-β]=0.80). Furthermore, we will determine the sex or gender and race or ethnicity of the participants, which would account for differences in the CDI performance, as well as the lead time-time to predict decompensation-and its relationship with the ultimate disease severity based on the World Health Organization COVID-19 ordinal scale. Conclusions: Using machine learning techniques on a large data set of patients with COVID-19 could provide valuable insights into the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and a digital biomarker for COVID-19 decompensation. Through this study, we intend to develop a tool that can uniquely reflect physiological data of a diverse population and contribute to high-quality data that will help researchers better understand COVID-19. ©Karen Larimer, Stephan Wegerich, Joel Splan, David Chestek, Heather Prendergast, Terry Vanden Hoek.

AB  - Introduction: Remote monitoring technologies (RMTs) can measure cognitive and functional decline objectively at-home, and offer opportunities to measure passively and continuously, possibly improving sensitivity and reducing participant burden in clinical trials. However, there is skepticism that age and cognitive or functional impairment may render participants unable or unwilling to comply with complex RMT protocols. We therefore assessed the feasibility and usability of a complex RMT protocol in all syndromic stages of Alzheimer's disease and in healthy control participants. Methods: For 8 weeks, participants (N = 229) used two activity trackers, two interactive apps with either daily or weekly cognitive tasks, and optionally a wearable camera. A subset of participants participated in a 4-week sub-study (N = 45) using fixed at-home sensors, a wearable EEG sleep headband and a driving performance device. Feasibility was assessed by evaluating compliance and drop-out rates. Usability was assessed by problem rates (e.g., understanding instructions, discomfort, forgetting to use the RMT or technical problems) as discussed during bi-weekly semi-structured interviews. Results: Most problems were found for the active apps and EEG sleep headband. Problem rates increased and compliance rates decreased with disease severity, but the study remained feasible. Conclusions: This study shows that a highly complex RMT protocol is feasible, even in a mild-to-moderate AD population, encouraging other researchers to use RMTs in their study designs. We recommend evaluating the design of individual devices carefully before finalizing study protocols, considering RMTs which allow for real-time compliance monitoring, and engaging the partners of study participants in the research. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Objective and continuous monitoring of physical activity over the long-term in the community is perhaps the most important step in the paradigm shift toward evidence-based practice and personalized therapy for successful community integration. With the advancement in technology, physical activity monitors have become the go-to tools for objective and continuous monitoring of everyday physical activity in the community. While these devices are widely used in many patient populations, their use in individuals with acquired brain injury is slowly gaining traction. The first step before using activity monitors in this population is to understand the patient perspective on usability and ease of use of physical activity monitors at different wear locations. However, there are no studies that have looked at the feasibility and patient perspectives on long-term utilization of activity monitors in individuals with acquired brain injury. Methods: This pilot study aims to fill this gap and understand patient-reported aspects of the feasibility of using physical activity monitors for long-term use in community-dwelling individuals with acquired brain injury. Results: This pilot study found that patients with acquired brain injury faced challenges specific to their functional limitations and that the activity monitors worn on the waist or wrist may be better suited in this population. Discussion: The unique wear location-specific challenges faced by individuals with ABI need to be taken into account when selecting wearable activity monitors for long term use in this population.

AB  - Although conventional skin-attachable electronics exhibit good functionalities, their direct attachment (without any adhesive) to human skin with sufficient conformal contact is challenging. Herein, all-solution-processed on-skin electronics based on self-reconfigurable high-weight-per- volume-gelatin (HWVG) film constructed using an effective, biocompatible water absorption-evaporation technique are demonstrated. Completely conformal contact of self-reconfigurable HWVG films is realized by rapidly inducing anisotropic swelling in the perpendicular direction and covering any curvature on the skin without spatial gap or void after shrinking. A sufficiently thin HWVG film (~2 um) exhibited higher adhesion owing to van der Waals force and the carboxylic acid and amine groups in HWVG film form cross-linkages through intermolecular bonds with human skin. Self-reconfigurable HWVG films with high biocompatibility are optimized to afford a superior efficiency of 87.83 % at a concentration of 20 % (w/v) and a storage modulus of 1822 MPa at 36.5 °C. Furthermore, functional nanoelectrodes consisting of self-reconfigurable silver nanowires/HWVG films for high-performance on-skin sensors allowing the detection of sensitive motion and electrophysiological signals, as well as an armband-type sensor system incorporated with a smartphone for health-care monitoring are demonstrated. Outstanding performances, including stability, reliability, flexibility, re-usability, biocompatibility, and permeability of on-skin electronics based on HWVG films can open-up a prospective route to realizing breathable human-machine interfaces based on biocompatible materials and processes. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The growing elderly population in smart home environments necessitates increased remote medical support and frequent doctor visits. To address this need, wearable sensor technology plays a crucial role in designing effective healthcare systems for the elderly, facilitating human–machine interaction. However, wearable technology has not been implemented accurately in monitoring various vital healthcare parameters of elders because of inaccurate monitoring. In addition, healthcare providers encounter issues regarding the acceptability of healthcare parameter monitoring and secure data communication within the context of elderly care in smart home environments. Therefore, this research is dedicated to investigating the accuracy of wearable sensors in monitoring healthcare parameters and ensuring secure data transmission. An architectural framework is introduced, outlining the critical components of a comprehensive system, including Sensing, Data storage, and Data communication (SDD) for the monitoring process. These vital components highlight the system's functionality and introduce elements for monitoring and tracking various healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. The collected data is subsequently communicated to healthcare providers to enhance the well-being of elderly individuals. The SDD taxonomy guides the implementation of wearable sensor technology through environmental and body sensors. The proposed system demonstrates the accuracy enhancement of healthcare parameter monitoring and tracking through smart sensors. This study evaluates state-of-the-art articles on monitoring and tracking healthcare parameters through wearable sensors. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of delineating the SSD taxonomy by classifying the system's major components, contributing to the analysis and resolution of existing challenges. It emphasizes the efficiency of remote monitoring techniques in enhancing healthcare services for the elderly in smart home environments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which requires complex medication regimens to mitigate motor symptoms. The use of digital health technology systems (DHTSs) to collect mobility and medication data provides an opportunity to objectively quantify the effect of medication on motor performance during day-to-day activities. This insight could inform clinical decision-making, personalise care, and aid self-management. This study investigates the feasibility and usability of a multi-component DHTS to remotely assess self-reported medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with Parkinson's (PwP). Methods: Thirty participants with PD [Hoehn and Yahr stage I (n = 1) and II (n = 29)] were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Participants were required to wear, and where appropriate, interact with a DHTS (smartwatch, inertial measurement unit, and smartphone) for seven consecutive days to assess medication adherence and monitor digital mobility outcomes and contextual factors. Participants reported their daily motor complications [motor fluctuations and dyskinesias (i.e., involuntary movements)] in a diary. Following the monitoring period, participants completed a questionnaire to gauge the usability of the DHTS. Feasibility was assessed through the percentage of data collected, and usability through analysis of qualitative questionnaire feedback. Results: Adherence to each device exceeded 70% and ranged from 73 to 97%. Overall, the DHTS was well tolerated with 17/30 participants giving a score > 75% [average score for these participants = 89%, from 0 (worst) to 100 (best)] for its usability. Usability of the DHTS was significantly associated with age (ρ = −0.560, BCa 95% CI [−0.791, −0.207]). This study identified means to improve usability of the DHTS by addressing technical and design issues of the smartwatch. Feasibility, usability and acceptability were identified as key themes from PwP qualitative feedback on the DHTS. Conclusion: This study highlighted the feasibility and usability of our integrated DHTS to remotely assess medication adherence and monitor mobility in people with mild-to-moderate Parkinson's disease. Further work is necessary to determine whether this DHTS can be implemented for clinical decision-making to optimise management of PwP.

AB  - Due to their excellent mechanical properties and high tensile strain sensitivity, conductive hydrogels show great potential applications in the fields of artificial intelligence and human-machine interaction. The integration of reliable resilience, excellent viscosity and high strain sensitivity is a great challenge for conductive hydrogels. Here, inspired by human skin with a layered structure, glycerol was first introduced into a dual-network structure to prepare a hydrogel with hydrogen bonds, endowing the hydrogels with high resilience and adhesion. A mixture of graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes was sprayed on the hydrogel as a conductive layer to achieve high strain sensing. Then, a hydrogel with good toughness and high resilience was prepared by in situ polymerization as an elastic layer. Benefitting from its unique crack response mechanism, the integrated sensor showed high sensitivity (gauge factor = 20). Additionally, it presented a wide strain range (0-300%), super adhesion (56.9 N m−1) to pigskin with similar elastic modulus to the human body, and low hysteresis. This study provides a feasible solution for the improvement of wearable electronic devices for healthcare monitoring. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The immune system plays a key role in protecting living beings against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, among other pathogens, which may be harmful and represent a threat to our own health. However, for reasons that are not fully understood, in some people this protective mechanism accidentally attacks the organs and tissues, thus causing inflammation and leads to the development of autoimmune diseases. Remote monitoring of human health involves the use of sensor network technology as a means of capturing patient data, and wearable devices, such as smartwatches, have lately been considered good collectors of biofeedback data, owing to their easy connectivity with a mHealth system. Moreover, the use of gamification may encourage the frequent usage of such devices and behavior changes to improve self-care for autoimmune diseases. This study reports on the use of wearable sensors for inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management based on a literature search and evaluation of an app prototype with fifteen stakeholders, in which eight participants were diagnosed with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases and four were healthcare professionals. Of these, six were experts in human–computer interaction to assess critical aspects of user experience. The developed prototype allows the monitoring of autoimmune diseases in pre-, during-, and post-inflammatory crises, meeting the personal needs of people with this health condition. The findings suggest that the proposed prototype—iShU—achieves its purpose and the overall experience may serve as a foundation for designing inflammation surveillance and autoimmune disease management monitoring solutions. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - On-skin patches that record biopotential and biomechanical signals are essential for wearable healthcare monitoring, clinical treatment, and human-machine interaction. To acquire wearing comfort and high-quality signals, patches with tissue-like softness, elastic recovery, damage tolerance, and robust bioelectronic interface are highly desired yet challenging to achieve. Here, we report a dry epidermal patch made from a supramolecular polymer (SESA) and an in situ transferred carbon nanotubes' percolation network. The polymer possesses a hybrid structure of copolymerized permanent scaffold permeated by multiple dynamic interactions, which imparts a desired mechanical response transition from elastic recoil to energy dissipation with increased elongation. Such SESA-based patches are soft (Young's modulus ∼0.1 MPa) and elastic within physiologically relevant strain levels (97% elastic recovery at 50% tensile strain), intrinsically mechanical-electrical damage-resilient (∼90% restoration from damage after 5 min), and interference-immune in dynamic signal acquisition (stretch, underwater, sweat). We demonstrate its versatile physiological sensing applications, including electrocardiogram recording under various disturbances, machine-learning-enabled hand-gesture recognition through electromyogram measurement, subtle radial artery pulse, and drastic knee kinematics sensing. This epidermal patch offers a promising noninvasive, long-duration, and ambulant bioelectronic interfacing with anti-interference robustness. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Remote monitoring systems have the potential to measure symptoms and treatment effects in people with Parkinson's disease (PwP) in the home environment. However, information about user experience and long-term compliance of such systems in a large group of PwP with relatively severe PD symptoms is lacking. Objective: The aim was to gain insight into user experience and long-term compliance of a smartwatch (to be worn 24/7) and an online dashboard to report falls and receive feedback of data. Methods: We analyzed the data of the “Bringing Parkinson Care Back Home” study, a 1-year observational cohort study in 200 PwP with a fall history. User experience, compliance, and reasons for noncompliance were described. Multiple Cox regression models were used to identify determinants of 1-year compliance. Results: We included 200 PwP (mean age: 69 years, 37% women), of whom 116 (58%) completed the 1-year study. The main reasons for dropping out of the study were technical problems (61 of 118 reasons). Median wear time of the smartwatch was 17.5 h/day. The online dashboard was used by 77% of participants to report falls. Smartphone possession, shorter disease duration, more severe motor symptoms, and less-severe freezing and balance problems, but not age and gender, were associated with a higher likelihood of 1-year compliance. Conclusions: The 1-year compliance with this specific smartwatch was moderate, and the user experience was generally good, except battery life and data transfer. Future studies can build on these findings by incorporating a smartwatch that is less prone to technical issues. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Flexible tactile sensors are under high pursuit for wearable electronics toward healthcare monitoring, human-machine interaction, and artificial intelligence. Permeability and hydrophobicity are emerging unique properties and require significant dedication of research efforts. Herein, we develop a type of flexible, breathable, and waterproof iontronic tactile sensor based on a nonwoven fabric platform using a facile dip-drying and solution-spraying technique. The intrinsic open-ended porous structure of the fabric offers air permeability (∼224.9 mm s-1), and the stearic acid microsheets decorated on the outside of the sensor provides effective hydrophobic protection (water contact angle ∼151.9°). The designed electrode-to-electrolyte interfacing microstructures of MXene microspheres and nanosheets on the fabric electrodes and the hierarchical structures with conical secondary features of chrysanthemum pollen on the fabric electrolyte endow the sensor with a high sensitivity of 214.92 kPa-1 and a wide detection range of 0-45 kPa. Fast response time, low detection limit, good dynamic response, and excellent stability are also achieved. With the help of a home-built mechatronic sensing system, the developed fabric tactile sensor can be practically used either as sensor units for human health status monitoring and motion detection or as a sensor array for spatial pressure distribution identification of human-object interaction. © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Ventricular assist devices (VADs) are effective therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure. Current VAD controllers offer improved interactivity, yet limitations of the visual, tactile, and auditory interface persist that impact patient experience and quality of life (QoL). This study explores how VAD controllers can be redesigned using a human-centered design approach to enhance the emotional and functional experience of the device for patients. Methods: VAD patients (n = 21), caregivers (n = 4) and healthcare practitioners (n = 24) were interviewed to uncover design opportunities. From this, a series of realistic scenarios to design for emerged. A “design by analogy” method took inspiration from existing consumer products to ideate new functionality for the VAD wearable system, creating concepts for a controller interface and paired wearable device. An additional 15 patients and 2 caregivers were engaged to explore current VAD controller experiences and evaluate the future-state concepts. Results: This research validated the need for increased automation and emergency functionality in VAD controllers, including remote monitoring of data, accurate communication of battery status, and automated medical alerts for critical device alarms. “Manage my health,” “Feeling normal,” “Social belonging,” “Feeling safe,” and “Sense of control” emerged as key patient concerns to be met by future VAD controller designs. Conclusions: The study demonstrated an innovative and relevant approach to improve usability of future VAD peripherals. By considering both emotional and functional perspectives in the design of lifesaving medical devices such as VADs, device manufacturers can uncover new opportunities to improve patient QoL through improved user experiences. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The field of wearable technology is undergoing a transformative shift with the integration of IoT-enabled, AI-assisted sensors into sportswear, bringing sophisticated performance analysis within reach for a broader audience. Despite advancements in stitch strain sensors, there is a significant research gap in developing high-performance, stable, and IoT-connected complete stitch strain wearable sensor systems. These advanced sensors are essential for enhancing wearable technology and meeting the growing demands for improved user experience and functionality. In this study by utilizing conductive sewing threads and innovative stitching techniques, we fabricated textile strain sensors that offer high sensitivity, flexibility, and durability. Extensive calibration tests revealed strong linear relationships between resistance and tensile strain, with highest sensor sensitivity (2.08 Ω/mm during loading and 2.72 Ω/mm during unloading). These sensors demonstrate reliable performance with minimal hysteresis, particularly in shorter lengths. The wearable sportswear device, tested in gym environments, demonstrated the sensor's capability to provide real-time feedback on knee flexing/bending and body movement during exercise. This functionality supports injury prevention and enhances workout efficiency. The sensor system is IoT-enabled, powered by an ESP8266 microcontroller, facilitating data transmission to the Thing Speak platform for advanced analysis and remote monitoring. This comprehensive approach not only advances wearable technology but also opens new avenues for remote health monitoring and smart e-textiles, contributing significantly to the fields of sports science and fitness technology. © 2024

AB  - Purpose Elderly people often face the risk of falls, which increases the need for walking aids to ensure mobility and safety. The occurrence of further injuries requires the use of additional orthopedic aids (e.g., foot orthoses). Wearing such an orthopedic aid also impairs the natural gait pattern, which leads to increased instability in older patients. This highlights the need for innovative solutions for assistive smart walking aids. Doan et al., for example, presented a smart walking aid for fall detection that can detect falls based on machine learning with an accuracy of 99.62% (Doan et al., 2024). This development can lead to improvements in home care and remote health monitoring technologies. However, a solution that allows the combined use of an intelligent walking aid with a smart foot orthosis to provide patients with active feedback does not exist. Based on the identified research gap, we propose the technical development of an augmented walking aid with haptic feedback that enables direct communication of sensor data with a smart foot orthosis. Providing additional feedback in case of problems with the foot orthosis is particularly important for patients with neuropathy in the feet (such as diabetic foot syndrome), for which neural feedback is not possible. Our approach enables direct haptic feedback through vibrations on the handle of the walking aid when acute problems are detected by the smart foot orthosis. The system achieves this by continuously monitoring relevant gait parameters and pressure distributions in the foot orthosis. This should support the proactive adaptation of gait problems and increase safety when using assistive technologies for older people. Method The concept development is based on a comprehensive literature analysis of existing walking aids, as well as the identification of patient needs for the use of augmented feedback and wearable technologies. Based on these findings, we have developed an initial concept for a feedback-enabled walking aid designed for combined use with a smart foot orthosis, which provides real-time feedback on the patient's gait behavior. Figure 1 shows the proposed conceptual design of the intelligent walking aid with an integrated vibration motor on the handle and an inertial measurement unit to determine the spatial parameters. Wireless communication of recorded data occurs via Bluetooth. Results and Discussion We propose to investigate the system in an experimental within-subject study to evaluate the effectiveness of gait improvement, as well as usability and social acceptance, with a sample size of 20 participants. In this context, we intend to use the think-aloud protocol to gain deeper insights into the participants’ thought processes during interaction with the system. By combining the proposed concept with a smart foot wearable device that provides specific data on foot positioning and movement, we expect a more reliable gait analysis and better tailored corrective suggestions. Additionally, the application of machine learning allows the identification of gait patterns and the initiation of preventive measures against potential fall risks. In future applications, the system can be modularly expanded to include additional walking aids, such as walking sticks, crutches, or walkers. © (2024), (International Society for Gerontechnology).

AB  - Wearable sensors with excellent comfort, flexibility and fast response are widely applied in human-machine interactions, artificial skin, motion detection and healthcare monitoring. However, preparation processes of the most of current piezoelectric sensors are relatively expensive and complicate, limiting their mass productions in the applications. This work demonstrates the superior piezoelectric performance and stability of ZnO/AlN flexible thin films prepared by magnetron sputtering for broad-range human motions detection, and first-principles calculation are applied to reveal the complicate piezoelectric effect of the hybrid system. The ZnO/AlN hybrid thin films sensor exhibits superior piezoelectric performance and excellent reliability, with presenting high outputs voltage (3.63 V), high degree of response speed (42.33 ms), water stability and robust performance upon 10000 cycles. First-principles calculations reveal that formation of the ZnO/AlN interface facilitates charge transport and improves efficiency of carrier transport, and results in reduced in band gap and enhanced electrical conductivity. By applying the sensors in human health monitoring, the underlying behaviors can be determined by output voltage of the sensor in real-time. This work offers a sensitive, simple structured and robust solution for human motion detection. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.

AB  - Background: Technological advances allow for recording and sharing health-related data in a patient-centric way using smartphones and wearables. Secure sharing of such patient-generated data with physicians would enable close management of individual health trajectories, monitoring of risk factors, and asynchronous feedback. However, most remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems currently available are not fully integrated into hospital IT systems or lack a patient-centric design. Objective: The objective of this study was to conceptualize and implement a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system incorporating asynchronous feedback mechanisms using a broadly available consumer wearable (Apple Watch). In addition, this study sought to evaluate factors influencing patient acceptance of such systems. Methods: The RPM system requirements were established through focus group sessions. Subsequently, a system concept was designed and implemented using an iterative approach ensuring technical feasibility from the beginning. To assess clinical feasibility, the system was used as part of the activeDCM prospective randomized interventional study focusing on dilated cardiomyopathy. Each patient used the system for at least 12 months. The System Usability Scale was used to measure usability from a subjective patient perspective. In addition, an evaluation was conducted on the objective wearable interaction frequency as well as the completeness of transmitted data classified into sensor-based health data (SHD) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Descriptive statistics using box plots and bootstrapped multiple linear regression with 95% CIs were used for evaluation analyzing the influence of age, sex, device experience, and intervention group membership. Results: The RPM system comprised 4 interoperable components: patient devices, a data server, a data viewer, and a notification service. The system was evaluated with 95 consecutive patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (28/95, 29% female; mean age 50, SD 12 y) who completed the activeDCM study protocol. The system’s app achieved a mean System Usability Scale score of 78 (SD 17), which was most influenced by device experience. In total, 87% (83/95) of the patients could integrate the use of the app well or very well into their daily routine, and 71% (67/95) saw a benefit of the RPM system for management of their health condition. On average, patients interacted with the wearable on 61% (SD 26%) of days enrolled in the study. SHD were available on average for 78% (SD 23%) of days, and PROM data were available on 64% (SD 27%) of weeks enrolled in the study. Wearable interaction frequency, SHD, and PROM completeness were most influenced by intervention group membership. Conclusions: Our results mark a first step toward integrating RPM systems based on a consumer wearable device for primary patient input into standardized clinical workflows. They can serve as a blueprint for creating a user-friendly, reusable, interoperable, and secure RPM system that can be integrated into patients’ daily routines. © Reto Wettstein, Farbod Sedaghat-Hamedani, Oliver Heinze, Ali Amr, Christoph Reich, Theresa Betz, Elham Kayvanpour, Angela Merzweiler, Christopher Büsch, Isabell Mohr, Birgit Friedmann-Bette, Norbert Frey, Martin Dugas, Benjamin Meder.

AB  - Simultaneous monitoring of human motion and collecting ambient energy are important for the development of personal healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. Here, a flexible and stretchable coaxial triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) yarn is designed and fabricated by using coil spring as the inner support layer and mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite as the outer friction layer. By weaving coaxial TENG yarns, or mix-weaving with other yarns, a multifunctional TENG fabric can be manufactured for energy harvesting external mechanical energy from human motion or ambient environment. More important, it can self-powered sense human motion in both electrical (through TENG) and optical (from mechanoluminescent ZnS:Cu/PDMS composite) methods. This work provides a new strategy for wearable TENG fabrics with dual-mode sensing and energy harvesting which have potential applications in long-term medical monitoring and human-machine interaction systems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As a pivotal component in human-machine interactions, display devices have undergone rapid development in modern life. Displays such as alternative current electroluminescence|alternative current electroluminescent (ACEL) devices with high flexibility and long operational lifetimes are essential for wearable electronics. However, ACEL devices are constrained by their inherent high driving voltage and complex fabrication processes. Our work presents an easy blade-coating method for fabricating flexible ACEL display devices based on an all-solution process. By dispersing BaTiO3 and ZnS/Cu powder into waterborne polyurethane, we successfully combined dielectric and fluorescence functionalities within a single layer, significantly reducing the device’s driving voltage. Additionally, the ionic conducting hydrogel was chosen as a transparent electrode to achieve good electrical contact and strong interfacial adhesion through in situ polymerization. Owing to the unique method, our ACEL device exhibits high flexibility, low driving voltage (20-100 V), high brightness (300+ cd/m2 at 60 V), and environmental friendliness. Furthermore, by repurposing the hydrogel electrode, we integrated strain visualization capabilities within a single device, highlighting its potential for applications such as wearable healthcare monitoring. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Although telehealth, and in particular RPM, have demonstrated to drive many benefits, such as reduction in cost and hospital-acquired infections, previous research has shown many usability challenges when patients operate a medical device without supervision of a medical professional. To combat this issue, the Pi-CON methodology is applied to develop a novel sensor with the objective to continuously acquire a patient’s vital signs from a distance, without the need to attach any markers or sensors to the patient, and with limited user interaction required. Pi-CON stands for passive, continuous and non-contact, and describes a way to improve the user experience for patients or caregivers that have a need to perform a vital signs measurement themselves, without the presence of a medical professional. The developed sensor utilises radar and optical sensing technologies and transmits acquired data to a cloud-based service where it can be viewed in near real-time by the patient or family members from anywhere via an intuitive user interface. This user interface, as well as the sensor itself were designed based on design needs and requirements to adhere to the user-centered design process. The development of the sensor, including utilised technologies, components, and the user interface are presented, including inspirations for future work. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Breathable and stretchable conductive materials are ideal for healthcare wearable electronic devices. However, the tradeoff between the sensitivity and detection range of electronic sensors and the challenge posed by simple-functional electronics limits their development. Here, inspired by the bionic-leaf vein conductive path, silver nanowires (AgNWs)-Ti3C2Tx (MXene) hybrid structure assembled on the nonwoven fabrics (NWF) is well sandwiched between porous polyborosiloxane elastomer (PBSE) to construct the multifunctional breathable wearable electronics with both high anti-impact performance and good sensing behavior. Benefiting from the high conductive AgNWs-MXene hybrid structure, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE nanocomposite exhibits high sensitivity (GF = 1158.1), wide monitoring range (57 %), controllable thermal management properties, and excellent electromagnetic interference shielding effect (SET = 41.46 dB). Moreover, owing to the wonderful shear stiffening effect of PBSE, the NWF/AgNWs-MXene/PBSE possesses a high energy absorption performance. Combining with deep learning, this breathable electronic device can be further applied to wireless sensing gloves and multifunctional medical belts, which will drive the development of electronic skin, human-machine interaction, and personalized healthcare monitoring applications. © 2024

AB  - Fueled by ongoing digitization efforts, manufacturing is currently undergoing a transformational process towards interconnected machinery and workforce, which enables a wide range of interactive monitoring and controlling applications. Whereas existing user-centered work addressed remote monitoring from office workplaces, it remains unclear how manufacturing workers experience and adopt machinery monitoring apps on mobile and wearable devices. To close this gap, we conducted a four-week field study in a running factory to study workers’ overall user experience and acceptance of such monitoring apps, the subjective impact on their work routines, and their preferred device type. Under productive operation, 11 manufacturing workers used functional application prototypes on smartphones and smartwatches to receive notifications of machine incidents. In 22 individual interviews and two focus groups, we collected the participants’ impressions and assessments. Based on these results, we derive a set of recommendations for designing and deploying machinery monitoring apps for manufacturing workers. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Human activity recognition (HAR) with wearable devices has shown superior usability in everyday life tracking and healthcare monitoring in recent years. To solve the existing challenges of weak sensor durability and difficulty capturing dynamic features of traditional wearable devices based on the long short-term memory neural network (LSTM), a new HAR system based on a pedal wearable device is proposed by utilizing a novel differential spatio-temporal LSTM (DST-LSTM) method. The pedal wearable device is embedded in the tongue area of the general footwear to obtain pedal musculoskeletal response (PMR) data of dorsum pedis. Based on the PMR data, the DST-LSTM is developed to classify five typical activity statuses as standing, sitting, floor walking, down the stairs and up the stairs. First, the dynamic differential information of the PMR data is taken into consideration to build a new LSTM unit. Second, the spatial relationship features of the PMR data are obtained by multi-head graph attention networks (GAT). Third, a novel spatial gate is added to the new LSTM unit to filter irrelevant spatial features and get valid information. The effectiveness and superiority of both the pedal wearable device and the DST-LSTM method are validated by comparison with the state-of-the-art methods and wearable devices. © 2022

AB  - Soft and stretchable strain sensors have aroused great interest in research and engineering fields due to their promising application potential in many areas, including human-machine interface and healthcare monitoring. However, developing stable, strain-sensitive, and fatigue-resistant wearable strain sensors remains challenging. Herein, we report a low-cost strain-sensing glove based on a commercial nitrile glove and liquid metal as both sensing units and circuit/interconnects, with excellent response to strains and great stability in long-term use. The liquid metal sensing circuit is prepared by scraping the liquid metal slurry in situ on glove fingers, followed by soft silicone encapsulation. The whole process does not involve toxic chemicals, so no strict requirements on the operating environment are necessary. The strain-sensing glove is capable of real-time monitoring of finger gestures in a very sensitive and accurate way, which exhibits great application potential as a soft controller in manipulating the machine hand to achieve related human-machine interaction. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Functional fibers have attracted much research attention due to their potential application in developing advanced electronic textiles for wearable devices. However, challenges still exist in preparing high-performance fiber-shaped sensors with superior flexibility and stretchability while achieving a high sensitivity and a wide detection range. Herein, we propose the design and fabrication of an ultra-flexible and super-elastic fiber-shaped strain sensor via a facile combining approach of wet-spinning and dip-coating. The sensor adopts a core-sheath configuration of liquid metal droplets dispersed in porous thermoplastic polyurethane as a substrate core and a carbon nanotube intertwined network embedding silver nanowires as a strain sensitive sheath. By taking advantage of both the composition of multiple functional materials and the design of a microstructured device configuration, the developed fiber-shaped sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity (maximum gauge factor of 7336.1), an extremely large workable strain range (500%), a low strain detection limit (0.5%), a fast response time (200 ms) and good stability (10 000 cycles). In addition, the sensor is temperature insensitive, inert under harsh solution conditions, degradable and recyclable. Intriguingly, the fiber-shaped sensor can be used to detect various human motions and gestures by directly attaching to skins or elaborately weaving into textiles, demonstrating its great potential in human healthcare monitoring and human-machine interactions. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: More responsive, reliable, and clinically valid endpoints of disability are essential to reduce size, duration, and burden of clinical trials in adult persons with spinal muscular atrophy (aPwSMA). Objective: The aim is to investigate the feasibility of smartphone-based assessments in aPwSMA and provide evidence on the reliability and construct validity of sensor-derived measures (SDMs) of mobility and manual dexterity collected remotely in aPwSMA. Methods: Data were collected from 59 aPwSMA (23 walkers, 20 sitters and 16 non-sitters) and 30 age-matched healthy controls (HC). SDMs were extracted from five smartphone-based tests capturing mobility and manual dexterity, which were administered in-clinic and remotely in daily life for four weeks. Reliability (Intraclass Correlation Coefficients, ICC) and construct validity (ability to discriminate between HC and aPwSMA and correlations with Revised Upper Limb Module, RULM and Hammersmith Functional Scale - Expanded HFMSE) were quantified for all SDMs. Results: The smartphone-based assessments proved feasible, with 92.1% average adherence in aPwSMA. The SDMs allowed to reliably assess both mobility and dexterity (ICC>0.75 for 14/22 SDMs). Twenty-one out of 22 SDMs significantly discriminated between HC and aPwSMA. The highest correlations with the RULM were observed for SDMs from the manual dexterity tests in both non-sitters (Typing, ρ=0.78) and sitters (Pinching, ρ=0.75). In walkers, the highest correlation was between mobility tests and HFMSE (5 U-Turns, ρ=0.79). Conclusions: This exploratory study provides preliminary evidence for the usability of smartphone-based assessments of mobility and manual dexterity in aPwSMA when deployed remotely in participants' daily life. Reliability and construct validity of SDMs remotely collected in real-life was demonstrated, which is a pre-requisite for their use in longitudinal trials. Additionally, three novel smartphone-based performance outcome assessments were successfully established for aPwSMA. Upon further validation of responsiveness to interventions, this technology holds potential to increase the efficiency of clinical trials in aPwSMA.  © 2024 - The authors. Published by IOS Press.

AB  - Background: Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring in daily life is essential for effective management of cardiovascular disease, a leading cause of death. Wearable ECG measurement systems in the form of clothing have been proposed to replace Holter monitors used for clinical ECG monitoring; however, they have limitations in daily use because they compress the upper body and, in doing so, cause discomfort during wear. Objective: The purpose of this study was to develop a wireless wearable ECG monitoring system that includes a textile ECG electrode that can be applied to the lining of pants and can be used in the same way that existing lower clothing is worn, without compression to the upper body. Methods: A textile electrode with stretchable characteristics was fabricated by knitting a conductive yarn together with polyester-polyurethane fiber, which was then coated with silver compound; an ECG electrode was developed by placing it on an elastic band in a modified limb lead configuration. In addition, a system with analog-to-digital conversion, wireless communication, and a smartphone app was developed, allowing users to be able to check and store their own ECGs in real time. A signal processing algorithm was also developed to remove noise from the obtained signal and to calculate the heart rate. To evaluate the ECG and heart rate measurement performance of the developed module, a comparative evaluation with a commercial device was performed. ECGs were measured for 5 minutes each in standing, sitting, and lying positions; the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates measured with both systems were then compared. Results: The system was developed in the form of a belt buckle with a size of 53 × 45 × 12 mm (width × height × depth) and a weight of 23 g. In a qualitative evaluation, it was confirmed that the P-QRS-T waveform was clearly observed in ECGs obtained with the wearable system. From the results of the heart rate estimation, the developed system could track changes in heart rate as calculated by a commercial ECG measuring device; in addition, the mean absolute percentage errors of heart rates were 1.80%, 2.84%, and 2.48% in the standing, sitting, and lying positions, respectively. Conclusions: The developed system was able to effectively measure ECG and calculate heart rate simply through being worn as existing clothing without upper body pressure. It is anticipated that general usability can be secured through further evaluation under more diverse conditions. © Danbi Gwon, Hakyung Cho, Hangsik Shin.

AB  - Background: Smart home and telemonitoring technologies have often been suggested to assist health care workers in supporting older people to age in place. However, there is limited research examining diverse information needs of different groups of health care workers and their access to appropriate information technologies. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the issues associated with using technologies that connect older people to their health care providers to support aging in place and enhance older people's health and well-being. Methods: Seven focus group discussions were conducted comprising 44 health care professionals who provided clinic-based or in-home services to community-dwelling older people. Participants were asked about their information needs and how technology could help them support older people to age in place. The recordings of the sessions were transcribed and thematically analyzed. Results: The perspectives varied between the respondents who worked in primary care clinics and those who worked in community-based services. Three overarching themes were identified. The first theme was “access to technology and systems,” which examined the different levels of technology in use and the problems that various groups of health care professionals had in accessing information about their patients. Primary care professionals had access to good internal information systems but they experienced poor integration with other health care providers. The community-based teams had poor access to technology. The second theme was “collecting and sharing of information,” which focused on how technology might be used to provide them with more information about their patients. Primary care teams were interested in telemonitoring for specific clinical indicators but they wanted the information to be preprocessed. Community-based teams were more concerned about gaining information on the patients' social environment. The third theme was that all respondents identified similar “barriers to uptake”: cost and funding issues, usability of systems by older people, and information security and privacy concerns. Conclusions: The participants perceived the potential benefits of technologies, but they were concerned that the information they received should be preprocessed and integrated with current information systems and tailored to the older people's unique and changing situations. Several management and governance issues were identified, which needed to be resolved to enable the widespread integration of these technologies into the health care system. The disconnected nature of the current information architecture means that there is no clear way for sensor data from telemonitoring and smart home devices to be integrated with other patient information. Furthermore, cost, privacy, security, and usability barriers also need to be resolved. This study highlights the importance and the complexity of management and governance of systems to collect and disseminate such information. Further research into the requirements of all stakeholder groups and how the information can be processed and disseminated is required. © Inga Hunter, Phoebe Elers, Caroline Lockhart, Hans Guesgen, Amardeep Singh, Dick Whiddett.

AB  - Background: Continuous monitoring of ECG, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, cardiac output, and cardiac index is important in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit (ICCU). However, monitoring these parameters in this setting and in these patients using noninvasive, wireless devices has not been conducted so far. We aimed to assess the use of a novel noninvasive continuous monitoring device in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU. Methods: Participants included STEMI patients that were admitted to the ICCU after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI). Patients were continuously monitored using a novel wearable chest patch monitor. Results: Fifteen patients with STEMI who underwent PPCI were included in this study. The median age was 52.8 years, the majority were males, and the median body mass index (BMI) was 25.7. Monitoring lasted for 66 ± 16 hours, and included the automatic collection and recording of all vitals, freeing the nursing staff to focus on other tasks. The user experience of nurses as reflected in filled questionnaires showed high satisfaction rates in all aspects. Conclusion: A novel noninvasive, wireless device showed high feasibility in continuously monitoring multiple crucial parameters in STEMI patients admitted to the ICCU after PPCI. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a degenerative neurological disorder that impairs motor functions and is accompanied by a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as sleep problems. Parkinsonism is assessed during clinical evaluations and via self-administered diaries and, based on these, the required medication therapies are provided to lessen symptoms. Tri-axial accelerometers and gyroscopes have the potential utility to objectively assess the patient's condition and aid clinicians in their decision-making. People with Parkinson's often have significant abnormalities in blood pressure due to comorbid age-related cardiovascular disease and orthostatic hypotension, which result in blurred vision, dizziness, and falls. Frequent blood pressure monitoring may aid in the evaluation of such events and differentiate Parkinson's disease symptoms from those originated by hypotension. In the present paper, a novel technology for the remote monitoring of Parkinsonian symptoms is presented: the WESAA system. It consists of two devices, worn on the wrist and ankle; its main function is to record accelerations and angular velocities from these body parts, together with photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram data. This information can be elaborated offline to measure common Parkinson's disease motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia), as well as gait speed, sleep-wake cycles, and cuff-less blood pressure measurements. The overall system requirements, market overview, industrial design and ergonomics, system development, user experience, early results of the gathered inertial raw data, and validation of the photoplethysmograph and electrocardiogram signal waveforms are all thoroughly discussed. The developed technology satisfies all system requirements, and the sensors adopted provided outcomes comparable with gold standard techniques. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Small-scale and high-performance energy storage devices have drawn tremendous attention with their portable, lightweight, and multi-functionalized features. Here, we present a foldable supercapacitor with affordable flexibility by adopting a developed design and electrode material system as a way to extend usability. Notably, to resolve the limited energy density of conventional capacitors, we successfully synthesize the CoO/NiCo-layered double hydroxide (LDH) core–shell nanostructure on Ni framework as a cathode material. Further, glucose-based activated carbon (GBAC) is utilized for the anode. The CoO/NiCo-LDH electrodes exhibited a high specific capacitance of ∼284.8 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1, and GBAC delivers a high specific capacitance of ∼166 F g−1 at 1 A g−1. In the following, the combinatorial integration of these materials enabled the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) to increase the energy density by enhancing the capacitance and the voltage window, in which a hydrogel-based electrolyte was facilitated for the foldable and wearable capability. The energy density of the ASC device was ∼24.9 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ∼779.5 W kg−1 with a voltage window of ∼1.6 V. As demonstrated, a self-powered energy source was demonstrated by a serially connected multi-ASC device with a help of a commercial solar cell, which was employed for powering wearable healthcare monitoring devices, including personal alarms for patients and recording the human body's electrical signals. The present work offers a viable approach to preparing potential candidates for high-performance electrodes of supercapacitors with deformable configurations to extend the powering capability of other electronic devices with physical functionalities used in wearable electronics. © 2022

AB  - From typical electrical appliances to thriving intelligent robots, the exchange of information between humans and machines has mainly relied on the contact sensor medium. However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross-infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human–machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high-sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water-absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Background: As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Sydney Local Health District in New South Wales, Australia, launched the rpavirtual program, the first full-scale virtual hospital in Australia, to remotely monitor and follow up stable patients with COVID-19. As part of the intervention, a pulse oximeter wearable device was delivered to patients to monitor their oxygen saturation levels, a critical indicator of COVID-19 patient deterioration. Understanding users’ perceptions toward the device is fundamental to assessing its usability and acceptability and contributing to the effectiveness of the intervention, but no research to date has explored the user experience of the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring in this setting. Objective: This study aimed to explore the use, performance, and acceptability of the pulse oximeter by clinicians and patients in rpavirtual during COVID-19. Methods: Semistructured interviews and usability testing were conducted. Stable adult patients with COVID-19 (aged ≥18 years) who used the pulse oximeter and were monitored by rpavirtual, and rpavirtual clinicians monitoring these patients were interviewed. Clinicians could be nurses, doctors, or staff who were part of the team that assisted patients with the use of the pulse oximeter. Usability testing was conducted with patients who had the pulse oximeter when they were contacted. Interviews were coded using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Usability testing was conducted using a think-aloud protocol. Data were collected until saturation was reached. Results: Twenty-one patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) and 15 clinicians (average age 41, SD 11 years) completed the interview. Eight patients (average age 51, SD 13 years) completed the usability testing. All participants liked the device and thought it was easy to use. They also had a good understanding of how to use the device and the device’s purpose. Patients’ age and device use–related characteristics (eg, the warmth of hands and hand steadiness) were identified by users as factors negatively impacting the accurate use of the pulse oximeter. Conclusions: Patients and clinicians had very positive perceptions of the pulse oximeter for COVID-19 remote monitoring, indicating high acceptability and usability of the device. However, factors that may impact the accuracy of the device should be considered when delivering interventions using the pulse oximeter for remote monitoring. Targeted instructions about the use of the device may be necessary for specific populations (eg, older people and patients unfamiliar with technology). Further research should focus on the integration of the pulse oximeter data into electronic medical records for real-time and secure patient monitoring. ©Andrea Torres-Robles, Karen Allison, Simon K Poon, Miranda Shaw, Owen Hutchings, Warwick J Britton, Andrew Wilson, Melissa Baysari.

AB  - The present work introduces ShoulPhy: a digital application, which includes a rehabilitation protocol for the treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome (SIS). ShoulPhy, short for Shoulder Physiotherapy enables the development of a patient-centred physiotherapy program and the remote monitoring of the patient’s adherence to the program, both in the clinic and daily life. The application provides a quantitative and effective evaluation of the therapeutic activity and functional level, through the use of wearable devices. The final aim was to facilitate the functional physical recovery and maintenance gained through the rehabilitation program, thus leading to a complete return to sport and routine activities. ShoulPhy underwent small scale tests both on healthy subjects and clinicians, which, in addition to evaluating the technical reliability of the system, assessed the usability and acceptance by clinicians and patients. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recent World Health Organization reports propose wearable devices to collect information on activity and walking speed as innovative health indicators. However, mainstream consumer-grade tracking devices and smartphone apps are often inaccurate and require long-term acceptability assessment. Objective: Our aim is to assess the user acceptability of an instrumented shoe insole in frail older adults. This device monitors participants'walking speed and differentiates active walking from shuffling after step length calibration. Methods: A multiphase evaluation has been designed: 9 older adults were evaluated in a living lab for a day, 3 older adults were evaluated at home for a month, and a prospective randomized trial included 35 older adults at home for 3 months. A qualitative research design using face-to-face and phone semistructured interviews was performed. Our hypothesis was that this shoe insole was acceptable in monitoring long-term outdoor and indoor walking. The primary outcome was participants' acceptability, measured by a qualitative questionnaire and average time of insole wearing per day. The secondary outcome described physical frailty evolution in both groups. Results: Living lab results confirmed the importance of a multiphase design study with participant involvement. Participants proposed insole modifications. Overall acceptability had mixed results: low scores for reliability (2.1 out of 6) and high scores for usability (4.3 out of 6) outcomes. The calibration phase raised no particular concern. During the field test, a majority of participants (mean age 79 years) were very (10/16) or quite satisfied (3/16) with the insole's comfort at the end of the follow-up. Participant insole acceptability evolved as follows: 63% (12/19) at 1 month, 50% (9/18) at 2 months, and 75% (12/16) at 3 months. A total of 9 participants in the intervention group discontinued the intervention because of technical issues. All participants equipped for more than a week reported wearing the insole every day at 1 month, 83% (15/18) at 2 months, and 94% (15/16) at 3 months for 5.8, 6.3, and 5.1 hours per day, respectively. Insole data confirmed that participants effectively wore the insole without significant decline during follow-up for an average of 13.5 days per 4 months and 5.6 hours per day. For secondary end points, the change in frailty parameters or quality of life did not differ for those randomly assigned to the intervention group compared to usual care. Conclusions: Our study reports acceptability data on an instrumented insole in indoor and outdoor walking with remote monitoring in frail older adults under real-life conditions. To date, there is limited data in this population set. This thin instrumentation, including a flexible battery, was a technical challenge and seems to provide an acceptable solution over time that is valued by participants. However, users still raised certain acceptability issues. Given the growing interest in wearable health care devices, these results will be useful for future developments. © 2021 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Background: With the increase in concern for deaths and illness related to the increase in temperature globally, there is a growing need for real-time monitoring of workers for heat stress indicators. The purpose of this study was to determine the usability of the Slate Safety (SS) wearable physiological monitoring system. Methods: Twenty nurses performed a common task in a moderate or hot environment while wearing the SS device, the Polar 10 monitor, and having taken the e-Celsius ingestible pill. Data from each device was compared for correlation and accuracy. Results: High correlation was determined between the SS wearable device and the Polar 10 system (0.926) and the ingestible pill (0.595). The SS was comfortable to wear and easily monitored multiple participants from a distance. Conclusions: The Slate Safety wearable device demonstrated accuracy in measuring core temperature and heart rate while not restricting the motion of the worker, and provided a remote monitoring platform for physiological parameters. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Flexible and wearable strain sensors with multi-functionalities have aroused tremendous attention for various applications in disease diagnostics, environment detection and healthcare monitoring, etc. However, limited electromechanical performance and complicated fabrication process of strain sensors restrict their extensive applications in full-range stimuli monitoring. Herein, we fabricated flexible and wearable strain sensors, consisting of a robust fiber with helical structure and two polyaniline (PANI) layers bridged by reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer through in-situ polymerization and ultrasonication. The flexible and wearable sensor possesses wide healthcare monitoring range (0.1%–200% strain), high sensibility especially for subtle deformation, excellent response stability, fast response/recovery time (100 ms/100 ms) and favorable durability. Meanwhile, our conductive PANI-rGO-PANI fiber (CPGPF) is assembled as a wearable sensor with the capability of precisely monitoring human body motions, temperature fluctuation and poisonous gas, indicating a promising multifunctional application in human-machine interaction and environment monitoring. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) technologies, such as wearable sensors, smart health devices, and mobile apps, that are capable of supporting pregnancy care are emerging. Although mHealth could be used to facilitate the tracking of health changes during pregnancy, challenges remain in data collection compliance and technology engagement among pregnant women. Understanding the interests, preferences, and requirements of pregnant women and those of clinicians is needed when designing and introducing mHealth solutions for supporting pregnant women’s monitoring of health and risk factors throughout their pregnancy journey. Objective: This study aims to understand clinicians’ and pregnant women’s perceptions on the potential use of mHealth, including factors that may influence their engagement with mHealth technologies and the implications for technology design and implementation. Methods: A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted with 4 pregnant women, 4 postnatal women, and 13 clinicians working in perinatal care. Results: Clinicians perceived the potential benefit of mHealth in supporting different levels of health and well-being monitoring, risk assessment, and care provision in pregnancy care. Most pregnant and postnatal female participants were open to the use of wearables and health monitoring devices and were more likely to use these technologies if they knew that clinicians were monitoring their data. Although it was acknowledged that some pregnancy-related medical conditions are suitable for an mHealth model of remote monitoring, the clinical and technical challenges in the introduction of mHealth for pregnancy care were also identified. Incorporating appropriate health and well-being measures, intelligently detecting any abnormalities, and providing tailored information for pregnant women were the critical aspects, whereas usability and data privacy were among the main concerns of the participants. Moreover, this study highlighted the challenges of engaging pregnant women in longitudinal mHealth monitoring, the additional work required for clinicians to monitor the data, and the need for an evidence-based technical solution. Conclusions: Clinical, technical, and practical factors associated with the use of mHealth to monitor health and well-being in pregnant women need to be considered during the design and feasibility evaluation stages. Technical solutions and appropriate strategies for motivating pregnant women are critical to supporting their long-term data collection compliance and engagement with mHealth technology during pregnancy. ©Jane Li, David Silvera-Tawil, Marlien Varnfield, M Sazzad Hussain, Vanitha Math.

AB  - Flexible wearable electronic sensors are regarded to facilitate revolutionary changes in human's daily life for their great promise in multifunctional artificial electronic skins, personalized healthcare monitoring, and smart human–machine interaction. However, there remains great challenges to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, broad sensing range and robust cyclic stability for high-performance personal diagnostic healthcare monitoring, excellent breathability for comfortable wearing, as well as environmentally friendly biodegradability for reducing electronic wastes. Herein, bioinspired by three-dimensional network structure of ant nest with high specific surface area, interconnected channels, and robust ventilation, a wearable, breathable, and biodegradable electronic sensor is prepared from facile face-to-face assembly of breathable biodegradable MXene-coated poly(1,8-octanediol-co-polycaprolactone citrate) elastomer sponge (MXene@POPLC), and an MXene ink-printed interdigitated electrode-coated breathable electrospun film. The as-obtained flexible electronic sensor exhibits high sensitivity (up to 246.3 kPa−1), broad sensing range (up to 333.3 kPa), reliable cycling stability (∼20,000 cycles), fast response (10 ms)/recovery time, robust breathability, excellent biocompatibility, facile biodegradability, and wireless wearable human–machine interfacing. Therefore, this line of research work opens up a novel avenue for the preparation of multifunctional wearable, breathable, and biodegradable electronics to hold great promise in smart healthcare monitoring, intelligent human–machine interaction, smart personal protection and next-generation artificial skin. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and symptoms for lung transplant recipients (LTRs) has become increasingly relevant in many situations. Nevertheless, RPM research integrating multisensory home monitoring in LTRs is scarce. We developed a novel multisensory home monitoring device and tested it in the context of COVID-19 vaccinations. We hypothesize that multisensory RPM and smartphone-based questionnaire feedback on signs and symptoms will be well accepted among LTRs. To assess the usability and acceptability of a remote monitoring system consisting of wearable devices, including home spirometry and a smartphone-based questionnaire application for symptom and vital sign monitoring using wearable devices, during the first and second SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Materials and Methods: Observational usability pilot study for six weeks of home monitoring with the COVIDA Desk for LTRs. During the first week after the vaccination, intensive monitoring was performed by recording data on physical activity, spirometry, temperature, pulse oximetry and self-reported symptoms, signs and additional measurements. During the subsequent days, the number of monitoring assessments was reduced. LTRs reported on their perceptions of the usability of the monitoring device through a purpose-designed questionnaire. Results: Ten LTRs planning to receive the first COVID-19 vaccinations were recruited. For the intensive monitoring study phase, LTRs recorded symptoms, signs and additional measurements. The most frequent adverse events reported were local pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance and headache. The duration of these symptoms was 5–8 days post-vaccination. Adherence to the main monitoring devices was high. LTRs rated usability as high. The majority were willing to continue monitoring. Conclusions: The COVIDA Desk showed favorable technical performance and was well accepted by the LTRs during the vaccination phase of the pandemic. The feasibility of the RPM system deployment was proven by the rapid recruitment uptake, technical performance (i.e., low number of errors), favorable user experience questionnaires and detailed individual user feedback. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) can be controlled well, but treatment often requires expert judgment. Telemedicine and sensor-based assessments can allow physicians to better observe the evolvement of symptoms over time, in particular with motor fluctuations. In addition, they potentially allow less frequent visits to the expert’s office and facilitate care in rural areas. A variety of systems with different strengths and shortcomings has been investigated in recent years. We designed a multimodal telehealth intervention (TelePark) to mitigate the shortcomings of individual systems and assessed the feasibility of our approach in 12 patients with PD over 12 weeks in preparation for a larger randomized controlled trial. TelePark uses video visits, a smartphone app, a camera system, and wearable sensors. Structured training included setting up the equipment in patients’ homes and group-based online training. Usability was assessed by questionnaires and semi-standardized telephone interviews. Overall, 11 out of 12 patients completed the trial (5 female, 6 male). Mean age was 65 years, mean disease duration 7 years, mean MoCA score 27. Adherence was stable throughout the study and 79% for a short questionnaire administered every second day, 62% for medication confirmation, and 33% for an electronic Hauser diary. Quality of life did not change in the course of the study, and a larger cohort will be required to determine the effect on motor symptoms. Interviews with trial participants identified motivations to use such systems and areas for improvements. These insights can be helpful in designing similar trials. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Digital devices have demonstrated benefits to patients with chronic and neurodegenerative diseases. But when patients use medical devices in their homes, the technologies have to fit into their lives. We investigated the technology acceptance of seven digital devices for home use. Methods: We conducted 60 semi-structured interviews with participants of a larger device study on their views on the acceptability of seven devices. Transcriptions were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we evaluated effort, facilitating conditions, performance expectancy and social influence of each device. In the effort category, five themes emerged: (a) the hassle to use the device; (b) its usability; (c) comfort; (d) disturbance to daily life; and (e) problems during usage. Facilitating conditions consisted of five themes: (a) expectations regarding a device; (b) quality of the instructions; (c) insecurities with usage; (d) possibilities of optimization; and (e) possibilities to use the device longer. Regarding performance expectancy, we identified three themes: (a) insecurities with the performance of a device; (b) feedback; and (c) motivation for using a device. In the social influence category, three themes emerged: (a) reactions of peers; (b) concerns with the visibility of a device; and (c) concerns regarding data privacy. Conclusions: We identify key factors that determine the acceptability of medical devices for home use from the participants’ perspective. These include low effort of use, minor disruptions to their daily lives and good support from the study team. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Multifunctional flexible wearable epidermic sensors have gained enormous attention for their promising potential applications in personal health management, electronic skins and intelligent human-machine interaction. However, it remains a critical challenge to realize a flexible breathable sensing device with reliable sensing performances for comfortably wearable human motion detection and ultrasensitive human-machine interfacing with the integrated functional capability of disease diagnosis and subsequent photothermal therapy simultaneously. Herein, a flexible breathable epidermic sensor is fabricated by delicately assembling conductive MXene nanosheets and silver nanowires (AgNWs) onto electrospun elastomeric substrates for ultrasensitive sensing and on-demand photothermal therapy. The as-prepared flexible breathable electronic sensor presents a broad sensing range (up to ∼120 %), ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor (GF) up to 4720), extremely low detection limit, remarkable reliability, and robust biocompatibility for serving as the electronic skin to monitor human physiological signals and wearable human-machine interaction. Moreover, it exhibits brilliant photothermal properties for enhanced antibacterial effect and timely photothermal therapy after healthcare monitoring and disease diagnosis. This work provides a facile way of developing flexible breathable multifunctional electronic sensors featured with excellent sensing ability, brilliant breathability and reliable photothermal properties for long-term healthcare monitoring, ultrasensitive wearable human-machine interfacing, smart disease diagnosis and treatment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: Wearable devices are progressively becoming an available tool for continuous seizure detection. Motivation to use wearables is not only driven by the accuracy and reliability of the performance but also by the form factor, comfort, and stability on the body. We collected direct feedback and device placement-related issues experienced by a cohort of people with epilepsy (PWE) to investigate to what extent available devices are nonintrusive, comfortable, and stable on the body. Methods: Four models of wearable devices (E4 wrist band, Everion upper arm band, IMEC upper arm band, and Epilog scalp patch electrodes) were worn by PWE who were admitted to two epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) in London and Freiburg. Participants were periodically reviewed, and accidental displacements of the devices were annotated. Participants' experience was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model Fast Form (TAM-FF) plus two additional questions on comfort. A thematic analysis was also performed on the free text of the questionnaire. Results: One hundred and fifteen participants were enrolled. The devices had a good stability on the body including during seizures. Overall, all the devices were considered comfortable to be worn, including during sleep. However, devices containing wires and patches demonstrated a lesser degree of stability on the body and were judged less positively. Participants age was correlated with TAM-FF mean scores, and older participants judged the devices less favorably compared with younger participants. Discussion: Removable but securely fitted, wireless, and comfortable designs were considered more appropriate for a continuous monitoring aimed at seizure detection. Some caution may be required when patch electrodes and electrodes glued to the skin or to the scalp are used, as those evaluated in the present study demonstrated a lower level of acceptability and a lower degree of stability to the body, especially at night. These factors could limit a continuous monitoring decreasing the device performance for nocturnal, unsupervised seizures which are at higher risk of lethality. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Wearable sensors have recently attracted extensive interest not only in the field of healthcare monitoring but also for convenient and intelligent human-machine interactions. However, challenges such as wearable comfort, multiple applicable conditions, and differentiation of mechanical stimuli are yet to be fully addressed. Herein, we developed a breathable and waterproof electronic skin (E-skin) that can perceive pressure/strain with nonoverlapping signals. The synergistic effect from magnetic attraction and nanoscaled aggregation renders the E-skin with microscaled pores for breathability and three-dimensional microcilia for superhydrophobicity. Upon applied pressure, the bending of conductive microcilia enables sufficient contacts for resistance decrease, while the stretching causes increased resistance due to the separation of conductive materials. The optimized E-skin exhibits a high gauge factor of 7.747 for small strain (0-80%) and a detection limit down to 0.04%. The three-dimensional microcilia also exhibit a sensitivity of -0.0198 kPa-1(0-3 kPa) and a broad detection range up to 200 kPa with robustness. The E-skin can reliably and precisely distinguish kinds of the human joint motions, covering a broad spectrum including bending, stretching, and pressure. With the nonoverlapping readouts, ternary inputs "1", "0", and "-1" could be produced with different stimuli, which expands the command capacity for logic outputs such as effective Morse code and intuitive robotic control. Owing to the rapid response, long-term stability (10 »000 cycles), breathability, and superhydrophobicity, we believe that the E-skin can be widely applied as wearable devices from body motion monitoring to human-machine interactions toward a more convenient and intelligent future. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Management of patients with multiple chronic diseases is a growing public health challenge, especially in rural sectors where access to physicians may be limited. Connected medical devices monitoring vital signs, associated with eHealth program and structured telephone support, may improve complex patient management through early detection of disease complications, positive impact on patients' health, and health resources consumption optimization. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical performance and user experience of the NOMHAD eHealth system in patients with multimorbidity. Methods: This was a pilot, single-arm, interventional study. Patients with multimorbidity with any combination of chronic heart failure (CHF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes were followed for 80-100 days using the NOMHAD eHealth system. This system used connected devices telemonitoring symptoms and vital signs (eg, body weight, oxygen saturation, pulse rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose), associated with structured telecoaching and educational support by call center nurses. An overall risk indicator (ORI) was automatically computed after each data teletransmission. The ORI was color coded; green indicated no action required; yellow, orange, and red (low to high priority, respectively) generated telenotifications and indicated to the nurses the need for a telecoaching action. Each ORI was calculated by combining 7 clinical stability system indicators based on symptom questionnaires and vital signs. Technical accuracy of the system was assessed by comparing system-generated ORIs with ORIs recalculated from raw data. Ease of use, usefulness, satisfaction, and acceptability of the system were assessed through patient adherence to self-assessments, and through self-administered questionnaires to patients, call center nurses, and physicians. Results: A total of 23 patients were enrolled in this study and participated between April 2016 and March 2017 at 5 study centers in France. All patients were successfully equipped and evaluable for analysis. Mean age was 68.5 (SD 10.4) years and most patients were men (n=20). The most common multimorbidity was CHF + diabetes (n=15), followed by patients with all 3 diseases (n=5). Mean effective follow-up was 78.7 (SD 24.2) days. The system generated 6263 ORIs, as several ORIs could be generated on a single day for any patient. Overall system sensitivity was 99.2% (95% CI 98.9-99.4) and overall specificity was 91.3% (95% CI 87.7-94.1). Most patients (20/23, 87%) were satisfied with the system and agreed that it helped them to better understand and manage their diseases, and 19/23 (83%) valued the nurse regular contacts. Nurses and physicians were generally satisfied with the system and considered it useful. All users indicated they would agree to long-term use of the system. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the NOMHAD eHealth system is accurate, acceptable, informative, and feasible for patients with multimorbidity, supporting further investigation of its clinical benefits. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Gait is among the most dependable, accurate, and secure methods of biometric identification. However, high power consumption and low computing capability are two major obstacles on wearable sensors-based gait recognition system. In this work, an integrated system is reported combining a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), a memristor (Ag/HfOx/Pt), and perovskite-based multicolor LEDs (PMCLED) for the visualization and recognition of foot patterns through signal-on-none and multi-wavelength on-device preprocessing. The flexible TENG acts as a sensory receptor, generating voltage based on the duration and intensity of pressure, which in turn promotes voltage-triggered synaptic plasticity in the memristor. The PMCLED, with its threshold switching and multi-wavelength emission characteristics, enables nonlinear filtering and amplification of the synaptic signal from the memristor, resulting in a simplified system design and reduced background noise. Additionally, the effectiveness of on-device preprocessing is validated based on a 5 × 5 array of integrated devices and software-built neural network for foot pattern visualization and recognition. The proposed system is able to recognize the on-device preprocessed images with high accuracy, indicating great potentials in both healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - The emergence of fibrous energy harvesters and self-powered sensors gives birth to functional wearable electronics. However, low power outputs, poor sensing abilities, and limited material selections have greatly restricted their developments. Herein, novel polycation-modified carbon dots (PCDs) tailored PCDs/polyvinyl alcohol nanocomposite polymer electrolytes (NPEs) are prepared and used as dominating triboelectric materials to construct a new NPEs-based fiber triboelectric nanogenerator (NPE-TENG) for the first time. The filling of PCDs endows NPEs with enhanced ionic conductivity. The developed NPE-TENG can respond to different mechanical stimuli with excellent flexibility and deliver a high power density of 265.8 µW m−1. Self-powered wearable sensor and smart glove based on NPE-TENG are further developed, which can achieve skin-level tactile sensing and joint-related activities monitoring in a rapid, real-time, and noninvasive way. As a sustainable power source, the NPE-TENG can drive small electronics and light up hundreds of light-emitting diodes. This study not only renders new insights into the development of triboelectric materials for fiber-based TENG but also provides a direction for potential applications of fibrous biomechanical energy harvesters and self-powered sensors in wearable electronics, personal healthcare monitoring, and human–machine interactions. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - Background: The recent growth of eHealth is unprecedented, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic. Within eHealth, wearable technology is increasingly being adopted because it can offer the remote monitoring of chronic and acute conditions in daily life environments. Wearable technology may be used to monitor and track key indicators of physical and psychological stress in daily life settings, providing helpful information for clinicians. One of the key challenges is to present extensive wearable data to clinicians in an easily interpretable manner to make informed decisions. Objective: The purpose of this research was to design a wearable data dashboard, named CarePortal, to present analytic visualizations of wearable data that are meaningful to clinicians. The study was divided into 2 main research objectives: to understand the needs of clinicians regarding wearable data interpretation and visualization and to develop a system architecture for a web application to visualize wearable data and related analytics. Methods: We used a wearable data set collected from 116 adolescent participants who experienced trauma. For 2 weeks, participants wore a Microsoft Band that logged physiological sensor data such as heart rate (HR). A total of 834 days of HR data were collected. To design the CarePortal dashboard, we used a participatory design approach that interacted directly with clinicians (stakeholders) with backgrounds in clinical psychology and neuropsychology. A total of 8 clinicians were recruited from the Rhode Island Hospital and the University of Massachusetts Memorial Health. The study involved 5 stages of participatory workshops and began with an understanding of the needs of clinicians. A User Experience Questionnaire was used at the end of the study to quantitatively evaluate user experience. Physiological metrics such as daily and hourly maximum, minimum, average, and SD of HR and HR variability, along with HR-based activity levels, were identified. This study investigated various data visualization graphing methods for wearable data, including radar charts, stacked bar plots, scatter plots combined with line plots, simple bar plots, and box plots. Results: We created a CarePortal dashboard after understanding the clinicians’ needs. Results from our workshops indicate that overall clinicians preferred aggregate information such as daily HR instead of continuous HR and want to see trends in wearable sensor data over a period (eg, days). In the User Experience Questionnaire, a score of 1.4 was received, which indicated that CarePortal was exciting to use (question 5), and a similar score was received, indicating that CarePortal was the leading edge (question 8). On average, clinicians reported that CarePortal was supportive and can be useful in making informed decisions. Conclusions: We concluded that the CarePortal dashboard integrated with wearable sensor data visualization techniques would be an acceptable tool for clinicians to use in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Nowadays, flexible pressure sensors have broad applications in healthcare monitoring, wearable electronics and so on. However, conventional fabrications are mostly time-consuming, complicated and even use toxic chemical reagents. It is in urgent need to fabricate pressure sensors with high sensitivity in a facile way. In nature, the fingertip skin of human has many epidermal ridges, which can sense small external stimuli. Here, inspired from the fingerprint, we propose a new type of pressure sensor made with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The rGO film is designed to form a wrinkled structure by a facile stretching-releasing process, which mimics the morphology of fingertip skin. Owing to the fingertip-skin-like wrinkled structure, the pressure sensor exhibits high sensitivity of 5.77 kPa−1 (0 - 490 Pa). It also has a lot of attractive properties, such as fast response (< 100 ms), small detecting pressure (3 Pa) and good repeatability. We show the ability of the pressure sensor in small pressure detecting, human motion monitoring and motion pattern recognition. Furthermore, a translation system and a multi-touch device with spatially resolved detection based on the pressure sensor are developed. This pressure sensor is hopeful to have potential applications in wearable electronics and human–machine interaction systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Piezoresistive sensors are indispensable in applications such as healthcare monitoring, artificial intelligence, and advanced communication systems. However, achieving wearable sensors that offer both high sensitivity and a wide linear range remains a significant challenge. Here, an all-carbon piezoresistive sensor is presented, named, featuring high biocompatibility, chemical stability, environmental sustainability, and a straightforward fabrication process. This sensor, integrating a double-sided pyramidal carbon aerogel (DPA) as the sensing layer, a silicone frame as the elastic support (ES), and superhydrophobic graphene-coated nylon fabric as the breathable conductive substrate (BCS), was named as DPA-ES@BCS. Finite element analysis confirms that the synergistic interaction between the DPA and silicone frame enhances the sensor's sensitivity while extending its linear range. This multiscale design achieves an exceptional sensitivity of 37.3 kPa−1, a broad linear detection ranges from 0 to 1.4 MPa, and outstanding stability over 30 000 cycles. Additionally, the high-performance wearable sensor is well-suited for real-time physiological signal monitoring and demonstrates exceptional capability in voice recognition, accurately distinguishing words using machine learning algorithms. Moreover, the DPA-ES@BCS sensor array shows great potential for enhancing information security through dual-factor authentication. This approach not only advances the piezoresistive performance of all-carbon sensors but also provides a strong foundation for developing next-generation sensor technologies. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Background: Physiotherapy for persons with Parkinson's disease (PwPD) could benefit from objective and continuous tracking of physical activity and falls in daily life. Objectives: We designed a remote monitoring system for this purpose and describe the experiences of PwPD and physiotherapists who used the system in daily clinical practice. Methods: Twenty-one PwPD (15 men) wore a sensor necklace to passively record physical activity and falls for 6 weeks. They also used a smartphone app to self-report daily activities, (near-)falls and medication intake. They discussed those data with their PD-specialized physiotherapist (n = 9) during three regular treatment sessions. User experiences and aspects to be improved were gathered through interviews with PwPD and physiotherapists, resulting in system updates. The system was evaluated in a second pilot with 25 new PwPD (17 men) and eight physiotherapists. Results: We applied thematic analysis to the interview data resulting in two main themes: usability and utility. First, the usability of the system was rated positively, with the necklace being easy to use. However, some PwPD with limited digital literacy or cognitive impairments found the app unclear. Second, the perceived utility of the system varied among PwPD. While many PwPD were motivated to increase their activity level, others were not additionally motivated because they perceived their activity level as high. Physiotherapists appreciated the objective recording of physical activity at home and used the monitoring of falls to enlarge awareness of the importance of falls for PwPD. Based on the interview data of all participants, we drafted three user profiles for PwPD regarding the benefits of remote monitoring for physiotherapy: for profile 1, a monitoring system could act as a flagging dashboard to signal the need for renewed treatment; for profile 2, a monitoring system could be a motivational tool to maintain physical activity; for profile 3, a monitoring system could passively track physical activity and falls at home. Finally, for a subgroup of PwPD the burdens of monitoring will outweigh the benefits. Conclusions: Overall, both PwPD and physiotherapists underline the potential of a remote monitoring system to support physiotherapy by targeting physical activity and (near-)falls. Our findings emphasize the importance of personalization in remote monitoring technology, as illustrated by our user profiles.

AB  - Objectives: Gout flares are painful and disabling. We developed a smartphone application (app) for patients to tele-monitor gout flares surveyed by clinicians. The aim of this study was to assess patient acceptability and technical and clinical feasibility. Methods: Adult patients with either established gout or high suspicion thereof were recruited if they possessed a smartphone and reported a recent arthritis attack. A smartphone application was used to identify gout flares by asking during 90 consecutive days: (1) what is your pain score (0-10); (2) are your joints warm; (3) are your joints swollen; and (4) are you currently experiencing a gout flare? The clinician was alerted via email if a flare occurred. Patient acceptability was assessed using the technology acceptance model. Technical feasibility consisted of reported technical issues and clinical feasibility of actions taken by the clinician regarding gout flare alerts. Results: Twenty-nine included patients completed the study. The mean age of participants was 57 years, and all but one were male. The adherence rate was 96% (110 of 2910 queries were missed). Patients had a positive attitude toward app use, found the app very easy to use (mean usability score 81 out of 100) and were neutral to positive on its usefulness. There were four minor technical issues. A total of 100 gout flare alerts were generated that led to 18 proactive contacts with patients. Conclusion: A smartphone app to monitor gout flares was developed and tested, showing high adherence, good acceptability and clinical feasibility for established gout patients.

AB  - Flexible electronic sensors are receiving numerous research interests for their potential in electronic skins (e-skins), wearable human-machine interfacing, and smart diagnostic healthcare sensing. However, the preparation of multifunctional flexible electronics with high sensitivity, broad sensing range, fast response, efficient healability, and reliable antibacterial capability is still a substantial challenge. Herein, bioinspired by the highly sensitive human skin microstructure (protective epidermis/spinous sensing structure/nerve conduction network), a skin bionic multifunctional electronics is prepared by face-to-face assembly of a newly prepared healable, recyclable, and antibacterial polyurethane elastomer matrix with conductive MXene nanosheets-coated microdome array after ingenious templating method as protective epidermis layer/sensing layer, and an interdigitated electrode as signal transmission layer. The polyurethane elastomer matrix functionalized with triple dynamic bonds (reversible hydrogen bonds, oxime carbamate bonds, and copper (II) ion coordination bonds) is newly prepared, demonstrating excellent healability with highly healing efficiency, robust recyclability, and reliable antibacterial capability, as well as good biocompatibility. Benefiting from the superior mechanical performance of the polyurethane elastomer matrix and the unique skin bionic microstructure of the sensor, the as-assembled flexible electronics exhibit admirable sensing performances featuring ultrahigh sensitivity (up to 1573.05 kPa−1), broad sensing range (up to 325 kPa), good reproducibility, the fast response time (≈4 ms), and low detection limit (≈0.98 Pa) in diagnostic human healthcare monitoring, excellent healability, and reliable antibacterial performance. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Smartphones are often equipped with inertial sensors that measure individuals' physical activity (PA). However, their role in remote monitoring of the patients' PAs in telemedicine needs to be adequately explored. Objective: This study aimed to explore the correlation between a participant's actual daily step counts and the daily step counts reported by their smartphone. In addition, we inquired about the usability of smartphones for collecting PA data. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted among patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery and a group of nonpatients as control. The data from the patients were collected from 2 weeks before surgery until 4 weeks after the surgery, whereas the data collection period for the nonpatients was 2 weeks. The participant's daily step count was recorded by PA trackers worn 24/7. In addition, a smartphone app collected the number of daily steps registered by the participants' smartphones. We compared the cross-correlation between the daily steps time series obtained from the smartphones and PA trackers in different groups of participants. We also used mixed modeling to estimate the total number of steps, using smartphone step counts and the characteristics of the patients as independent variables. The System Usability Scale was used to evaluate the participants' experience with the smartphone app and the PA tracker. Results: Overall, 1067 days of data were collected from 21 patients (n=11, 52% female patients) and 10 nonpatients (n=6, 60% female patients). The median cross-correlation coefficient on the same day was 0.70 (IQR 0.53-0.83). The correlation in the nonpatient group was slightly higher than that in the patient group (median 0.74, IQR 0.60-0.90 and median 0.69, IQR 0.52-0.81, respectively). The likelihood ratio tests on the models fitted by mixed effects methods demonstrated that the smartphone step count was positively correlated with the PA tracker's total number of steps (2 1=34.7, P<.001). In addition, the median usability score for the smartphone app was 78 (IQR 73-88) compared with median 73 (IQR 68-80) for the PA tracker. Conclusions: Considering the ubiquity, convenience, and practicality of smartphones, the high correlation between the smartphones and the total daily step count time series highlights the potential usefulness of smartphones in detecting changes in the number of steps in remote monitoring of a patient's PA. © 2023 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Developing a sensor that can read out cross-talk free signals while determining various active physiological parameters is demanding in the field of point-of-care applications. While there are a few examples of non-flexible sensors available, the management of electronic waste generated from such sensors is critical. Most of such available sensors are rigid in form factor and hence limit their usability in healthcare monitoring due to their poor conformity to human skin. Combining these facets, studies on the development of a recyclable cross-talk free flexible sensor for monitoring human motions and active parameters are far and few. In this work, we report on the development of a recyclable flexible sensor that can provide accurate data for detecting small changes in strain as well as pressure. The developed sensor could decipher the signals individually responsible due to strain as well as pressure. Hence, it can deliver a cross-talk free output. Thermoplastic polyurethane and graphene were selected as the model system. The thermoplastic polyurethane/graphene sensor exhibited a tensile strain sensitivity of GF ≃ 3.375 for 0-100% strain and 10.551 for 100-150% strain and a pressure sensitivity of ∼−0.25 kPa-1. We demonstrate the applicability of the strain sensor for monitoring a variety of human motions ranging from a very small strain of eye blinking to a large strain of elbow bending with unambiguous peaks and a very fast response and recovery time of 165 ms. The signals received are mostly electrical hysteresis free. To confirm the recyclability, the developed sensor was recycled up to three times. Marginal decrement in the sensitivity was noted with recycling without compromising the sensing capabilities. These findings promise to open up a new avenue for developing flexible sensors with lesser carbon footprints. © 2023 American Chemical Society

AB  - In the last months, the market for personal wearable devices has been booming significantly, and, in particular, smartwatches are starting to assume a fundamental role in the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) arena as well as in the more general Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, by acting both as sensitive data sources and as user identity proxies. These new roles, complementing the more traditional personal assistance and telemetry/tracking ones, open new perspectives in their integration in complex IoT-based critical infrastructures such as e-payment, health care monitoring, and emergency systems, as well as in their usage as remote control facilities in smart services. Users can access their IoT devices at any time from any place through smartwatches. We argue that this new scenario calls for a strengthened and more resilient authentication of users on these devices, despite their limitations in terms of dimensions and hardware constraints that may considerably affect the usability of security mechanisms. In this article, we present an innovative authentication scheme targeted at smartwatches, namely CirclePIN, that provides both resilience to most common attacks and a high level of usability in tests with real users. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Wearable electronics based on natural biocompatible fibers have attracted considerable interests due to the promising use for healthcare monitoring, human–machine interactions, and smart clothing. However, crucial challenges to design robust, flexible, and highly sensitive fiber sensors remain, to meet various requirements for practical application. Herein, Fischer esterification and in situ polymerization technologies were employed to produce conductive nanocelluloses (CNC–PEDOT), which possessed excellent mechanical stiffness and high conductivity (238 μS/cm). Then, silk yarns as supporting materials were functionalized by as-prepared conductive units to construct all-in-one fiber sensor (SCP) for multiple signals monitoring. Surprisingly, the resulted SCP fiber showed impressive mechanical performances (422.86 MPa at 18.44%), due to the strong hydrogen-bond interaction between SY substrate and CNC–PEDOT conductive units. More importantly, SCP fiber was employed a dual-function sensor for real-time monitoring of strain and temperature, illustrating remarkable sensitivities, i.e., gauge factor = 4.28 in a large strain range of 0–16%, and sensitivity = 1.55%/℃ in a broad temperature range of 25–60 ℃. The SCP fiber sensor with impressive mechanical performances and high sensitivity, can be applied for real-time health monitoring in wearable biosensors, smart healthcare, and on-demand therapy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the Korean Fiber Society 2024.

AB  - Wearable, flexible, and even stretchable tactile sensors, such as various types of electronic skin, have attracted extensive attention, which can adapt to complex and irregular surfaces, maximize the matching of wearable devices, and conformally apply onto human organs. However, it is a great challenge to simultaneously achieve breathability, permeability, and comfortability for their development. Herein, mitigating the problem by miniaturizing and integrating the sensors is tried. Highly flexible and stretchable coaxial structure fiber-shaped triboelectric nanogenerators (F-TENGs) with a diameter of 0.63 mm are created by orderly depositing conductive material of silver nanowires/carbon nanotubes and encapsulated polydimethylsiloxane onto the stretchable spandex fiber. As a self-powered multifunctional sensor, the resulting composite fiber can convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals without affecting the normal human body. Moreover, the F-TENGs can be easily integrated into traditional textiles to form tactile sensor arrays. Through the tactile sensor arrays, the real-time tactile trajectory and pressure distribution can be precisely mapped. This work may provide a new method to fabricate fiber-based pressure sensors with high sensitivity and stretchability, which have great application prospects in personal healthcare monitoring and human–machine interactions. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH

AB  - The HEALthy Brain and Child Development (HBCD) Study, a multi-site prospective longitudinal cohort study, will examine human brain, cognitive, behavioral, social, and emotional development beginning prenatally and planned through early childhood. Wearable and remote sensing technologies have advanced data collection outside of laboratory settings to enable exploring, in more detail, the associations of early experiences with brain development and social and health outcomes. In the HBCD Study, the Novel Technology/Wearable Sensors Working Group (WG-NTW) identified two primary data types to be collected: infant activity (by measuring leg movements) and sleep (by measuring heart rate and leg movements). These wearable technologies allow for remote collection in the natural environment.

AB  - The monitoring of proximity-contact events is essential for human-machine interactions, intelligent robots, and healthcare monitoring. We report a dual-modal sensor made with two functionalized optical microfibers (MFs), which is inspired by the somatosensory system of human skin. The integrated sensor with a hierarchical structure gradationally detects finger approaching and touching by measuring the relative humidity (RH) and force-triggered light intensity variations. Specifically, the RH sensory part shows enhanced evanescent absorption, achieving a sensitive RH measurement with a fast response (110 ms), a high resolution (0.11%RH), and a wide working range (10-100%RH). Enabled by the transition from guided modes into radiation modes of the waveguiding MF, the force sensory part exhibits a high sensitivity (6.2%/kPa) and a fast response (up to 1.5 kHz). By using a real-time data processing unit, the proximity-contact sensor (PCS) achieves continuous detection of the full-contact events, including finger approaching, contacting, pressing, releasing, and leaving. As a proof of concept, the electromagnetic-interference-free PCS enables a smart switch system to recognize the proximity and contact of bare/gloved fingers. Moreover, skin humidity detection and respiration monitoring are realized. These initial results pave the way toward a category of optical collaborative devices ranging from human-machine interfaces to multifunctional on-skin healthcare sensors. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Long-term, real-time, and comfortable epidermal electronics are of great practical importance for healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction. However, traditional physiological signal monitoring confined by the specific clinical sites and unreliability of the epidermal electrodes leads to great restrictions on its application. Herein, we constructed a solution-processed submicron (down to 230 nm), free-standing, breathable sandwich-structured hybrid electrode composed of a silver nanowire network with a conductive polymer film, which is conformal, water-permeable, and noninvasive to the skin while achieving good signal acquisition ability. The free-standing hybrid electrode is prepared via an in situ capillary force lift-off process and can be transferred onto complex surfaces. The whole process is a complete solution process that facilitates large-area preparation and application. The light-weight hybrid electrodes exhibit high optical transmittance, high electrical conductivity, and high gas/ion permeability. When the hybrid electrodes are attached onto the skin, the imperceptible films show high conformality with low electrical impedance, thus exhibiting significantly improved electrocardiology and electromyogram signal monitoring performance compared to that of the commercial gel electrodes. © 2020 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Wearable smart textiles based on natural biocompatible materials have attracted considerable interests due to the promising use for healthcare management, human-machine interactions, and remote monitoring. However, assembling conductive yarns into smart textiles and wearable sensing devices based on silks is hardly investigated. Herein, a bottom-up and scalable strategy of constructing smart fabric from conductive yarns units is presented. Specifically, silk yarns are functionalized by customized conductive paints consisted of polyaniline (PANI) and carbon nanotubes (CNT), which selectively etches the interface of yarns without damage of their internal structures. The as-prepared sensing units not only maintain the characters of silk, PANI and CNT, with robust mechanical performances and high conductivity, but also can efficiently monitor a series of critical signals, such as strain, temperature and harmful gas. The sensing units can be sewed into fabric to integrate flexible smart textiles, and the obtained smart textiles preserve the structural integrity and detection capacity under deformations, frictions and water exposure. An integrated textile device is also shown, which consists of display and warning can serve as a health butler, demonstrating the system's potential within the “internet of things” in various areas, including motion monitoring and smart home. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Flexible and wearable humidity sensors play a vital role in daily point-of-care diagnosis and noncontact human-machine interactions. However, achieving a facile and high-speed fabrication approach to realizing flexible humidity sensors remains a challenge. In this work, a wearable capacitive-type Ga2O3/liquid metal-based humidity sensor is demonstrated by a one-step laser direct writing technique. Owing to the photothermal effect of laser, the Ga2O3-wrapped liquid metal particles can be selectively sintered and converted from insulative to conductive traces with a resistivity of 0.19 Ω·cm, while the untreated regions serve as active sensing layers in response to moisture changes. Under 95% relative humidity, the humidity sensor displays a highly stable performance along with rapid response and recover time. Utilizing these superior properties, the Ga2O3/liquid metal-based humidity sensor is able to monitor human respiration rate, as well as skin moisture of the palm under different physiological states for healthcare monitoring. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Wearable sensing electronics capable of detecting and differentiating multiple mechanical stimuli are promising devices in the applications of healthcare monitoring, robotics, etc. However, most wearable sensors are developed for detecting only uniaxial mechanical stimuli, which severely hinders their practical applications that usually involve complex mechanical stimuli. Here, a wing-like multifunctional sensor (WMS) consisting of pressure sensing module in the middle and stretching sensing module in both wings is developed with the capability of detecting and differentiating pressure, stretching, convex and concave bending through distinct electrical signals variation trends. The hierarchical in-situ filling porous as pressure sensing layer and micro-wrinkled carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/Ag nanoflakes as stretch sensing layer achieve high sensitivity over a broad range in both pressure (sensitivity of 0.25 kPa−1 at 500 kPa) and strain sensing (Gauge factor of 140 at 150%). The pressure and stretch sensing module can work without interfering with each other, which is realized by structural design of lower Young's modulus stretch sensing module and higher thickness and compressibility pressure sensing module. Then WMS is demonstrated in accurate detection of human kinesthesia, human-computer interface, identification of objects of various hardnesses and sizes by robotic gripper, and perception of environmental information through a crawling robot. © 2023

AB  - Flexible, breathable, and degradable pressure sensors with excellent sensing performance are drawing tremendous attention for various practical applications in wearable artificial skins, healthcare monitoring, and artificial intelligence due to their flexibility, breathability, lightweight, decreased electronic rubbish, and environmentally friendly impact. However, traditional plastic or elastomer substrates with impermeability, uncomfortableness, mechanical mismatches, and nondegradability greatly restricted their practical applications. Therefore, the fabrication of such pressure sensors with high flexibility, facile degradability, and breathability is still a critical challenge and highly desired. Herein, we present a wearable, breathable, degradable, and highly sensitive MXene/protein nanocomposites-based pressure sensor. The fabricated MXene/protein-based pressure sensor is assembled from a breathable conductive MXene coated silk fibroin nanofiber (MXene-SF) membrane and a silk fibroin nanofiber membrane patterned with a MXene ink-printed (MXene ink-SF) interdigitated electrode, which can serve as the sensing layer and the electrode layer, respectively. The assembled pressure sensor exhibits a wide sensing range (up to 39.3 kPa), high sensitivity (298.4 kPa-1 for 1.4-15.7 kPa; 171.9 kPa-1 for 15.7-39.3 kPa), fast response/recovery time (7/16 ms), reliable breathability, excellent cycling stability over 10 »000 cycles, good biocompatibility, and robust degradability. Furthermore, it shows great sensing performance in monitoring human psychological signals, acting as an artificial skin for the quantitative illustration of pressure distribution, and wireless biomonitoring in real time. Considering the biodegradable and breathable features, the sensor may become promising to find potential applications in smart electronic skins, human motion detection, disease diagnosis, and human-machine interaction.  ©

AB  - Background: Over recent years, interest in the development of smart health technologies aimed at supporting independent living for older populations has increased. The integration of innovative technologies, such as the Internet of Things, wearable technologies, artificial intelligence, and ambient-assisted living applications, represents a valuable solution for this scope. Designing such an integrated system requires addressing several aspects (eg, equipment selection, data management, analytics, costs, and users'needs) and involving different areas of expertise (eg, medical science, service design, biomedical and computer engineering). Objective: The objective of this study is 2-fold; we aimed to design the functionalities of a smart health platform addressing 5 chronic conditions prevalent in the older population (ie, hearing loss, cardiovascular diseases, cognitive impairments, mental health problems, and balance disorders) by considering both older adults'and clinicians' perspectives and to evaluate the identified smart health platform functionalities with a small group of older adults. Methods: Overall, 24 older adults (aged >65 years) and 118 clinicians were interviewed through focus group activities and web-based questionnaires to elicit the smart health platform requirements. Considering the elicited requirements, the main functionalities of smart health platform were designed. Then, a focus group involving 6 older adults was conducted to evaluate the proposed solution in terms of usefulness, credibility, desirability, and learnability. Results: Eight main functionalities were identified and assessed-cognitive training and hearing training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 6/6, 100%), monitoring of physiological parameters (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 6/6, 100%; learnability: 5/6, 83%), physical training (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 5/6, 83%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), psychoeducational intervention (usefulness: 6/6, 100%; credibility: 6/6, 100%; desirability: 4/6, 67%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), mood monitoring (usefulness: 4/6, 67%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 3/6, 50%; learnability: 5/6, 50%), diet plan (usefulness: 5/6, 83%; credibility: 4/6, 67%; desirability: 1/6, 17%; learnability: 2/6, 33%), and environment monitoring and adjustment (usefulness: 1/6, 17%; credibility: 1/6, 17%; desirability: 0/6, 0%; learnability: 0/6, 0%). Most of them were highly appreciated by older participants, with the only exception being environment monitoring and adjustment. The results showed that the proposed functionalities met the needs and expectations of users (eg, improved self-management of patients' disease and enhanced patient safety). However, some aspects need to be addressed (eg, technical and privacy issues). Conclusions: The presented smart health platform functionalities seem to be able to meet older adults' needs and desires to enhance their self-awareness and self-management of their medical condition, encourage healthy and independent living, and provide evidence-based support for clinicians' decision-making. Further research with a larger and more heterogeneous pool of stakeholders in terms of demographics and clinical conditions is needed to assess system acceptability and overall user experience in free-living conditions. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Stretchable sensors have been widely investigated and developed for the purpose of human motion detection, touch sensors, and healthcare monitoring, typically converting mechanical/structural deformation into electrical signals. The viscoelastic strain of stretchable materials often results in nonlinear stress−strain characteristics over a broad range of strains, consequently making the stretchable sensors at the body joints less accurate in predicting and recognizing human gestures. Accurate recognition of human gestures can be further deteriorated by environmental changes such as temperature and humidity. Here, we demonstrated an environment-adaptable high stress−strain linearity (up to ε = 150%) and high-durability (>100,000 cycles) stretchable sensor conformally laminated onto the body joints for human gesture recognition. The serpentine configuration of our ionic liquid-based stretchable film enabled us to construct broad data sets of mechanical strain and temperature changes for machine learning-based gesture recognition. Signal recognition and training of distinct strains and environmental stimuli using a machine learning-based algorithm analysis successfully measured and predicted the joint motion in a temperature-changing environment with an accuracy of 92.86% (R-squared). Therefore, we believe that our serpentine-shaped ion gel-based stretchable sensor harmonized with machine-learning analysis will be a significant achievement toward environmentally adaptive and multianalyte sensing applications. Our proposed machine learning-enabled multisensor system may enable the development of future electronic devices such as wearable electronics, soft robotics, electronic skin, and human-machine interaction systems. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Monitoring the physiological signals of people by using wearable sensors attached to the skin while they go about their daily routine is a practical approach to prevent diseases and monitor people’s health status. However, conventional monitoring devices are bulky, their signals are corrupted by the noise generated by external sources, and they are prone to mechanical failure, which hinder their practical use. Herein, a mechanically durable biomaterial-based arterial pulse thin-film sensor is developed for real-time monitoring of cyclic physiological signals. A hierarchical layered material (rGO/SF/CNC) comprising reduced graphene oxide (rGO), silk fibroin (SF), and cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is fabricated using the spin-assisted layer-by-layer (SA-LbL) technique and thermal reduction. Thermal reduction is performed to tailor the defects in rGO, which significantly enhances its mechanical robustness and bending properties, as well as in-plane stress sensitivity, owing to a change in conductivity. The thin-film (thickness: 40.9 nm) sensor has a rapid response time (69 ms) and excellent durability exceeding 8000 cycles. Moreover, it is insensitive to strain in the orthogonal direction, which significantly reduces the noise level and dramatically increases its sensitivity. The sensor’s suitability for practical use as an arterial pulse sensor for monitoring physiological signals is demonstrated. The developed thin-film flexible stress sensor has the potential to contribute toward the improvement of wearable healthcare monitoring devices and human–machine interaction.

AB  - Background: Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are a primary cause of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes worldwide. For women at risk of hypertensive complications, guidelines recommend frequent surveillance of blood pressure and signs of preeclampsia. Clinic visits range from every 2 weeks to several times a week. Given the wide ubiquity of smartphones and computers in most countries and a growing attention for self-management, digital technologies, including mobile health (mHealth), constitute a promising component of monitoring (self-measured) blood pressure during pregnancy. Currently, little is known about the experiences of women using such platforms and how mHealth can be aligned with their needs and preferences. Objective: The objectives were twofold: (1) to explore the experiences of Dutch women who had an increased risk of HDP with a blended care approach (mHealth combined with face-to-face care) for remote self-monitoring of blood pressure and preeclampsia symptoms and (2) to formulate recommendations for the use and integration of mHealth in clinical care. Methods: Alongside a prospective blended care study (SAFE@home study) that monitors pregnant women at increased risk of HPD with mHealth technology, a mixed methods study was conducted, including questionnaires (n=52) and interviews (n=11). Results were analyzed thematically. Results: Of the 4 themes, 2 themes were related to the technologies themselves (expectations, usability), and 2 themes were related to the interaction and use of mHealth (autonomy and responsibilities of patients, responsibilities of health care professionals). First, the digital platform met the expectations of patients, which contributed to user satisfaction. Second, the platform was considered user-friendly, and patients favored different moments and frequencies for measuring their blood pressure. Third, patient autonomy was mentioned in terms of increased insight about their own condition and being able to influence clinical decision making. Fourth, clinical expertise of health care professionals was considered essential to interpret the data, which translates to subsequent responsibilities for clinical management. Data from the questionnaires and interviews corresponded. Conclusions: Blended care using an mHealth tool to monitor blood pressure in pregnancy was positively evaluated by its users. Insights from participants led to 7 recommendations for designing and implementing similar interventions and to enhance future, morally sound use of digital technologies in clinical care. © Karin Rolanda Jongsma, Josephus F M van den Heuvel, Jasmijn Rake, Annelien L Bredenoord, Mireille N Bekker.

AB  - Background: The increasing interest in remote patient monitoring technologies in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requires a phased and stepwise investigative approach, which includes high-risk clinical subgroups who stand to benefit most from such innovations. Methods: Patients aged > 40 with spirometry-confirmed COPD presenting with a current acute exacerbation (ECOPD) were recruited from a tertiary centre Day Hospital in this prespecified feasibility study. Heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, skin temperature, and daily activity and overnight sleep quality parameters were collected remotely by a wearable biometric wristband and ring for 21 consecutive days. “Total ambulatory wear time” and “percent of useable data” for eligible vital sign parameters were calculated. Correlation and agreement between cardiorespiratory vital sign data were performed using Spearman’s correlation rho and the Bland-Altman test, respectively. User experience was measured with end-of-study System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaires. Results: Nine participants (mean age 66.8 ± 8.4 years, 22% female, mean FEV1 1.4L (34.1% predicted), with “severe” (56%) or “very severe” (44%) COPD) experiencing a current ECOPD were included. Wear time was 94% (wristband) and 88.2% (ring) of the total ambulatory study period. Wristband-obtained data (every 1 min, artefact-free) revealed 99.2% and 98.6% of all heart rate and temperature data, respectively, was useable, whereas only 17.6% of all respiratory rate data was useable. Ring-obtained data (every 5 min, “average” and “good” quality) revealed 84.5% of all heart rate data was useable. Cross-sectional analyses with nurse-obtained vital signs revealed correlation coefficients of 0.56 (p = 0.11) and 0.81 (p = 0.0086) for wristband-obtained and ring-obtained heart rate, respectively, and only 0.15 (p = 0.74) for wristband-obtained respiratory rate, without evidence of systematic/proportional bias. Longitudinal heart rate and respiratory rate inter-device analyses demonstrated correlations of 0.86 (p < 0.001) and 0.65 (p < 0.001), respectively. Finally, end-of-study SUS scores were 86.4/100 (wristband) and 89.2/100 (ring). Conclusion: Older adults with severe/very severe COPD experiencing a current ECOPD were capable of autonomous physiological data collection/upload/transmission from their home environment over several weeks using sophisticated wearable biometric technology, with favourable user experiences. Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparative results call into question the paradigm of single sets of infrequent/interval vital sign checks as the current “gold-standard” in frontline clinical practice.

AB  - Wearable pressure sensors have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in healthcare monitoring and human-machine interaction. However, it is still a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, low detection limit, fast response, and outstanding breathability for wearable electronics due to the difficulty in constructing microstructure on a porous substrate. Inspired by the spinosum microstructure of human skin for highly-sensitive tactile perception, a biomimetic flexible pressure sensor is designed and fabricated by assembling MXene-based sensing electrode and MXene-based interdigitated electrode. The product biomimetic sensor exhibits good flexibility and suitable air permeability (165.6 mm s−1), comparable to the typical air permeable garments. Benefiting from the two-stage amplification effect of the bionic intermittent structure, the product bionic sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity (1368.9 kPa−1), ultrafast response (20 ms), low detection limit (1 Pa), and high-linearity response (R2 = 0.997) across the entire sensing range. Moreover, the pressure sensor can detect a wide range of human motion in real-time through intimate skin contact, providing essential data for biomedical monitoring and personal medical diagnosis. This principle lays a foundation for the development of human skin-like high-sensitivity, fast-response tactile sensors. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Objective: This paper introduces RemoteHealthConnect, a novel web-based healthcare system designed to enable healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely with enhanced efficacy. Central to our system is its integration with the Vitaliti™ wearable, equipped with biosensors for real-time vital signs monitoring. RemoteHealthConnect distinguishes itself by offering advanced, custom visualizations for interactive engagement with medical data, facilitating rapid clinical decision-making through intuitive access to vital signs and trends. The primary research question we sought to answer was: ‘Which design of vital sign visualizations is most effective in improving intuitive and rapid understanding for healthcare practitioners?’ Methods: An iterative agile/SCRUM methodology was employed in the design and development of RemoteHealthConnect. We describe the architectural design of our web-based application, data visualization techniques, and user interface design. A user interface/user experience (UI/UX) study was conducted to assess the efficacy of our system. Results: The usability study revealed the system's capacity to translate complex bedside data into accessible, real-world visualizations, promoting efficient pattern recognition and anomaly detection. This is crucial for enhancing clinician performance, regardless of the patient's location. The paper further details a usability study involving healthcare practitioners to ascertain RemoteHealthConnect's efficacy. The System Usability Scale (SUS) assessment yielded a score of 71.5, indicating high usability. This score is significant, positioning our system above the average usability threshold for healthcare technologies, and suggesting it as a valuable tool for remote patient monitoring. Conclusion: Our web-based healthcare system and findings from the usability study contribute to the domains of Mobile Health (mHealth) and e-Health by advancing remote monitoring capabilities and offering a promising avenue for healthcare IT to improve patient care and clinician workflow. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Footwear smart devices capable of reliably capturing body actions and conveniently transmitting human-made information are of great interest to advance healthcare monitoring, human-machine interactions (HMIs), etc. while remaining challenging. Herein, we present a self-powered, antislip, and multifunctional smart outsole based on the gecko toe-inspired tilted magnetized flakes (TMFs) and underlying flexible coils. With the pressure-induced flake deflection and the built-in magnetic moment alignment, the TMF can produce a variable magnetic field to induce the voltage signals in coils for precise pressure perception and linear velocity sensing. The TMF-based smart outsole can thus serve as a real-time footwear recorder to monitor various body actions for exercise analysis and to track the abnormal landing speed for alerting potential injuries. The gecko toe-like flakes also enable the excellent antislip capability of the outsole with a much higher friction coefficient than the standard one of the low slip risk. By programming the magnetic moment alignments of the TMFs, a single-circuit outsole can further output multiple signals as encoded instructions for controlling the racing game. Along with excellent abrasion resistance and environmental immunity, the proposed outsole exhibits great potential as a convenient platform for reliable healthcare monitoring and efficient HMI. © 2024 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a common and distressing condition among pancreatic cancer patients. Fewer than a quarter of pancreatic cancer patients receive medical nutrition therapy (MNT), important for improving nutritional status, weight maintenance, quality of life and survival. System, provider, and patient level barriers limit access to MNT. We propose to examine the feasibility of a 12-week multi-level, digital health intervention designed to expand MNT access among pancreatic cancer patients. Methods: Individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer starting chemotherapy (N = 80) will be 1:1 randomized to the intervention or usual care. The Support Through Remote Observation and Nutrition Guidance (STRONG) intervention includes system-level (e.g., routine malnutrition and screening), provider-level (e.g., dietitian training and web-based dashboard), and patient-level strategies (e.g., individualized nutrition plan, self-monitoring of dietary intake via Fitbit, ongoing goal monitoring and feedback). Individuals receiving usual care will be referred to dietitians based on their oncologists’ discretion. Study assessments will be completed at baseline, 4-, 8-, 12-, and 16-weeks. Results: Primary outcomes will be feasibility (e.g., recruitment, retention, assessment completion) and acceptability. We will collect additional implementation outcomes, such as intervention adherence, perceived usability, and feedback on intervention quality via an exit interview. We will collect preliminary data on outcomes that may be associated with the intervention including malnutrition, quality of life, treatment outcomes, and survival. Conclusion: This study will advance our knowledge on the feasibility of a digital health intervention to reduce malnutrition among individuals with advanced pancreatic cancer.

AB  - Conductive hydrogels have attracted tremendous attention for the next-generation electronic/energy/robotic application owing to their excellent mechanical and electrical properties, including stretchability, high conductivity, and stability. How to simultaneously realize their highly transparent, self-healing, antifreezing/antidrying, biocompatible and highly conductive features through a simple approach is still a challenge. Herein, the stretchable freezing-tolerant triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and strain sensor have been developed based on a transparent, long-term stable, and highly conductive gelatin/NaCl organohydrogel (GNOH), which is prepared via a facile immersion strategy in a glycerol/water binary solvent. The GNOH demonstrates superior merits of strain (300%), transparency (85%), high conductivity (1.6 S/m), freezing tolerance (−20 ℃), self-healing capability (91%), and environment stability (over 30 days). Furthermore, the wearable strain sensors enable the detecting, quantifying, and monitoring of human activities with high sensitivity of about 2.5 (strain of 0–200%). Meanwhile, the fabricated TENG in single-electrode mode can achieve excellent electrical outputs to power portable electronics when efficiently harvesting biomechanical energies, even at harsh cold temperature (−20 ℃). Additionally, a flexible self-powered calculator based on the arrayed TENG as touch panel is also explored for human-machine interaction (HMI). This study paves the way for potential applications in wearable electronics, healthcare monitoring, biomechanical energy harvesting and HMI. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Purpose: wearable devices aimed at detecting seizures are rapidly emerging. Continuous collection and optimal data quality are paramount to guarantee the acquisition of clinically meaningful data. It is still unknown how successfully patients can self-manage new technologies and which factors have an impact on this. We assessed the performance of patients managing a wrist-worn device. Method: patients wearing a wrist-worn device received a single training session to perform 5 tasks: (1) fitting the device correctly; (2) switching the device on and off; (3) charging the device on a daily basis; (4) pairing the device with a phone or tablet; (5) seeking assistance. Participants were then reviewed every 24 h and, at the end of the study, a Wearable technology Self-management Score (WSS) was calculated according to their performance in the different tasks (0–12). The association between WSS, seizure capture, demographics and clinical characteristics was analysed. Results: Thirty patients were included. The mean WSS score was 9.4 ± 2.1 points. The task more often performed inaccurately was pairing the device with a phone or tablet, followed by performing charging procedures. A strong association was found between WSS and seizure capture (p = 0.019), with higher scores strongly associated with more seizures captured. A WSS of ≥9 was the minimum value of WSS that allowed the device to record all the seizures. Number of AEDs and illness-perception related factors (perceived disease timeline and personal control) were significantly associated with WSS. Conclusions: Overall, participants demonstrated good performances in self-managing a wrist-worn device. Digital inequalities may extend to variations in how different individuals feel about their own disease and, consequently, manage the technology. These aspects should be addressed when technological solutions are delivered to users. © 2020 British Epilepsy Association

AB  - As an engineering frontier, highly stretchable sensors are widely applied in many fields, such as human motion detection, personal healthcare monitoring, and human-machine interactions. In this study, novel silver nanowire (AgNW)-based stretchable sensors with hierarchical wrinkled structures were fabricated through a two-step process, namely water-induced swelling and AgNW deposition. As highly soluble additives, sodium chloride particles were incorporated into the elastomer matrix. Upon soaking in dopamine aqueous solution, significant swelling was introduced onto the elastomer substrate. The dopamine deposition is accompanied with the swelling process, which endows the sample surface with ultra-hydrophilicity. Additionally, the dopamine-modified swollen samples “capture” the nanowires when subsequently immersed in AgNW/ethanol suspension, because the dopamine acts as a highly adhesive layer. Finally, the sensors with wrinkled conductive network have been constructed upon removal of residual water. Both films and 3D printed sensors were fabricated and their electrical properties were systematically characterized. The fabricated sensors exhibit high sensitivity when subjected to external deformation from 10% to 100% strains, good electrical repeatability during 8000 stretching/releasing cycles, and reliable electrical responses in different frequencies of stretching/releasing. Human motion detection has been demonstrated using the 3D printed sensors, revealing the potential application in wearable electronics for healthcare monitoring and rehabilitation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Wearable and elastic pressure sensors have caused widespread concern due to the popularity of smart terminals and human health monitoring. To obtain a flexible pressure sensor with a wide detection region and outstanding sensitivity, exploring new materials and novel structures has become the first choice for the research. Here, a wearable and flexible MXene fibrous network pressure sensor (MFNS) with a high sensitivity and wide detection region is reported. The holistic fiber network is composed of pure MXene fibers; among them, MXene fibers were prepared by wet-spinning of MXene nanosheets. The MFNS exhibits a high sensitivity in a wide detection region (51 kPa-1for 14.7 kPa and 427 kPa-1within the 14.7-19.9 kPa range), a low detection limit (8 Pa), a robust durability (10,000 cycles), and a prompt response (95 ms). Due to the superior performance of MFNS, it also proves prospective applications for human motion signal detection (such as swallowing, pulse beat, and joint motion) and measuring pressure distribution. This work provides an effective way to fabricate a high-performance pressure sensor for human-machine interactions, personal healthcare monitoring, and multitouch devices. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Flexible pressure sensors have been studied as wearable voice-recognition devices to be utilized in human-machine interaction. However, the development of highly sensitive, skin-attachable, and comfortable sensing devices to achieve clear voice detection remains a considerable challenge. Herein, we present a wearable and flexible pressure and temperature sensor with a sensitive response to vibration, which can accurately recognize the human voice by combing with the artificial neural network. The device consists of a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) printed with a silver electrode, a filament-microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film embedded with single-walled carbon nanotubes and a polyimide (PI) film sputtered with a patterned Ti/Pt thermistor strip. The developed pressure sensor exhibited a pressure sensitivity of 0.398 kPa−1 in the low-pressure regime, and the fabricated temperature sensor shows a desirable temperature coefficient of resistance of 0.13%◦ C in the range of 25◦ C to 105◦ C. Through training and testing the neural network model with the waveform data of the sensor obtained from human pronunciation, the vocal fold vibrations of different words can be successfully recognized, and the total recognition accuracy rate can reach 93.4%. Our results suggest that the fabricated sensor has substantial potential for application in the human-computer interface fields, such as voice control, vocal healthcare monitoring, and voice authentication. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The emerging fields of the Internet of Things, intelligent robotics, and smart biomedical devices have sparked an increasing demand for high-performance thermoelectric (TE) devices due to their efficient conversion of thermal energy into electrical power, and vice versa. The environmentally friendly (Bi, Sb)2Te3 (BST) system, which displays superior performance near room temperature, offers a promising solution for optimizing thermoelectrics to meet the needs of commercial applications. Here, we utilized AgInSe2 alloying to enhance the TE and mechanical properties of BST, aiming to optimize electron and phonon transport and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The synergistic optimization resulted in a peak zT of ∼ 1.3 at 353 K and an average zTave of ∼ 1.11 from 303 K to 503 K in BST-0.1 %AgInSe2, as well as a high Vickers hardness of ∼ 105 Hv. Through rational optimization of the TE device, we achieved a maximum conversion efficiency of ∼ 6 % at a temperature difference of 210 K. Leveraging the robust TE output of the device, we further evaluated its potential as a self-powered information interaction wristband device based on ASCII codes. We envisage this versatile TE device being extensively applied in power generation and human–machine interaction, with promising potential in wearable electronics, telecommunications, and healthcare monitoring. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Swiss Primary Hypersomnolence and Narcolepsy Cohort Study (SPHYNCS) is a multicenter research initiative to identify new biomarkers in central disorders of hypersomnolence (CDH). Whereas narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is well characterized, other CDH disorders lack precise biomarkers. In SPHYNCS, we utilized Fitbit smartwatches to monitor physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters over 1 year. We examined the feasibility of long-term ambulatory monitoring using the wearable device. We then explored digital biomarkers differentiating patients with NT1 from healthy controls (HC). A total of 115 participants received a Fitbit smartwatch. Using a adherence metric to evaluate the usability of the wearable device, we found an overall adherence rate of 80% over 1 year. We calculated daily physical activity, heart rate, and sleep parameters from 2 weeks of greatest adherence to compare NT1 (n=20) and HC (n=9) participants. Compared to controls, NT1 patients demonstrated findings consistent with increased sleep fragmentation, including significantly greater wake-after-sleep onset (p=.007) and awakening index (p=.025), as well as standard deviation of time in bed (p=.044). Moreover, NT1 patients exhibited a significantly shorter REM latency (p=.019), and sleep latency (p=.001), as well as a lower peak heart rate (p=.008), heart rate standard deviation (p=.039) and high-intensity activity (p=.009) compared to HC. This ongoing study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term monitoring with wearable technology in patients with CDH and potentially identifies a digital biomarker profile for NT1. While further validation is needed in larger datasets, these data suggest that long-term wearable technology may play a future role in diagnosing and managing narcolepsy.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Vertigo, dizziness, gaze instability and disequilibrium are highly prevalent in people with MS (PwMS) and head movement induced dizziness is commonly reported. Vestibular physical therapy (VPT) is a specialised, non-invasive and effective therapy for these problems but usually involves travel for the person to a specialist center with both personal and carbon costs. The use of wearable sensors to track head movement and smartphone applications to deliver and track programs has potential to improve VPT in MS. Methods: This study investigated the usability and effects of a commercially available digital VPT system (wearable head sensor, smartphone app and clinician software) to deliver VPT to PwMS. A pre/post treatment design was employed and the primary outcome was the System Usability Scale (SUS). Other patient reported outcomes were the Service User Acceptability Questionnaire (SUTAQ), the Patient Enablement Instrument (PEI) and the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI). Physical outcomes measurements included Mini-BESTest (MB), Modified Dynamic Gait Index (mDGI), Gait Speed (GS), Dynamic Visual Acuity (DVA) and head kinematics and symptoms during exercise. Results: Sixteen PwMS (14 female), mean age 44(±14) years were recruited to the study and twelve completed VPT. Mean adherence to exercise, measured digitally was 60% (±18.4). SUS scores were high at 81 (±14) and SUTAQ scores also demonstrated high levels of satisfaction and acceptability of the system. Statistically significant improvements in MB (mean change 2.25; p = 0.004), mDGI (median change 1.00; p = 0.008), DVA (median change −1.00; p = 0.004) were found. Head frequencies significantly improved with concurrent decreased intensity of dizziness during head movements (mean change across 4 gaze stabilization exercises was 23 beats per minute; p < 0.05). Non-significant improvements were seen in DHI (p = 0.07) and GS (p = 0.15). 64.5% of follow up visits were conducted remotely (video or phone), facilitated by the system. Discussion: This study had two main outcomes and benefits for PwMS. Firstly, we showed that the system used was both acceptable and could be used by PwMS. Secondly, we demonstrated an improvement in a range of dizziness, balance and gait metrics with remotely delivered care. This system has the potential to positively impact on MS physiotherapy service provision with the potential to deliver effective remote care. 2024 Meldrum, Kearney, Hutchinson, McCarthy and Quinn.

AB  - Background: During the 30-day period prior to initiating dialysis, there is a 10-fold rise in emergency department visits and hospitalizations related to kidney failure. Objective: The Virtual Ward Incorporating Electronic Wearables (VIEWER) trial implemented a home telemonitoring system to track changes in patients’ vitals and assess their adherence and the acceptability of telemonitoring in a chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. Design: A pilot prospective clinical trial using a mixed methods approach was performed. Setting: The research was conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants: There were 2 phases: Phase 1 was a 2-week-long pilot trial consisting of 10 participants. Phase 2 was a 3-month-long trial with a total of 26 participants. Patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 and a >40% risk of beginning dialysis in the next 2 years according to the kidney failure risk equation were eligible to participate in the study. Methods: The primary quantitative outcome was adherence, defined as the proportion of daily self-assessments completed using VIEWER over the follow-up period. The usability and acceptability of VIEWER was assessed qualitatively at the end of the trial through structured questionnaires and focus groups. Results: Phase 1 participants (n = 10) had a median adherence of 77.17% for the 2-week observation period. Phase 2 participants (n = 26) showed a lower median adherence of 36% for the 3-month period. Focus group participants (n = 11) identified many positive aspects of VIEWER, including increased awareness and empowerment over health, simplicity of the data platform, and the ability to show clinical staff their health trends. Some challenges identified with VIEWER were connectivity issues with the Bluetooth, perceived inconvenience, and negative thoughts toward their health Limitations: Limitations of the study include a small sample size, which limited our ability to measure quantitative outcomes. In addition, patients agreeing to participate in any trial are generally more highly motivated and engaged in their care than those declining participation. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to individuals who are not interested in self-management of their health. Conclusion: Our results suggest that home telemonitoring in patients with advanced CKD is feasible using a CKD-specific platform like VIEWER. We anticipate that improved functionality with incorporation of feedback from this study will result in greater long-term adherence. A future randomized clinical trial is planned. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Introduction. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is an inflammatory condition affecting over 25% of adults. Web/mobile technology offers potential benefits in the treatment of KOA by improving access to care and reducing costs by utilising mobile devices for medical care and patient education. Aim. The study aims to answer the question of what needs, functional requirements and aesthetic preferences patients with knee osteoarthritis have and what barriers and facilitators there are when using an app-based therapy. Material and methods. We used a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews with 20 patients. Results and conclusion. Interviewees emphasized that effective KOA management apps must address diverse patient needs, ensure accessibility, offer customizable features, provide comprehensive information and self-management tools, support pain relief, enable remote monitoring, integrate with support communities, and be cost-efficient. These apps should combine functional requirements, such as a simple user interface, integration with wearable devices, educational content, exercise guidance, pain management tools, remote consultations, community support, and feedback mechanisms, with aesthetic preferences for clear, accessible design, large fonts, high-contrast colours, suitable interactive elements, consistent layout, guiding animations, and accessibility features like text resizing, voice commands, and audio descriptions. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity for KOA management apps to integrate diverse functional requirements and aesthetic preferences, ensuring accessibility, customization, comprehensive information, and support features to enhance usability, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. © 2024 Author(s).

To address these issues, we developed the IMPACT platform, comprising a real-time mobile application for data collection and a web-based dashboard for remote monitoring and management. Methods: This article presents the design, development, and usability assessment of the IMPACT platform customized for patients with post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia (PBH). We focus on adapting key IMPACT components, including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), symptom tracking, and meal logging, as crucial elements for user-friendly and efficient PBH monitoring. Results: The adapted IMPACT platform demonstrated effectiveness in data collection and remote participant monitoring. The mobile application allowed patients to easily track their data, while the clinician dashboard provided a comprehensive overview of enrolled patients, featuring filtering options and alert mechanisms for identifying data collection issues. The platform incorporated various visual representations, including time plots and category-based visualizations, which greatly facilitated data interpretation and analysis. The System Usability Scale questionnaire results indicated a high level of usability for the web dashboard, with an average score of 86.3 out of 100. The active involvement of clinicians throughout the development process ensured that the platform allowed for the collection and visualization of clinically meaningful data. Conclusions: By leveraging IMPACT’s existing features and infrastructure, the adapted version streamlined data collection, analysis, and trial customization for PBH research. The platform’s high usability underscores its alignment with the requirements for conducting research using continuous real-world data in PBH patients and other populations of interest. © 2023 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Wearable and flexible capacitive pressure sensors have recently attracted significant attention in the fields of healthcare monitoring and intelligent human-machine interaction. While considerable progress is made in achieving high-pressure resolution over a wide linearity range, practical implementation still faces significant challenges due to complex manufacturing processes, as well as limited accuracy and stability for information transmission. To address these issues, inspiration is drawn from human skin and develop a new hybrid dielectric comprising a low-permittivity (low-k) micro-cilia array and a high-permittivity (high-k) foam. Without assistance from an elaborate fabrication methodology, the template-free method provides a cost-effective and convenient way to realize the functional dielectric for flexible capacitive sensors. The hybrid dielectric exhibits a pressure-induced series-parallel conversion mechanism, enabling effective manipulation of the linear effective dielectric constant and controlled initial/resultant capacitance. Through systematic optimization, the sensor demonstrates a high sensitivity of 0.236 kPa−1 within an ultrabroad linearity range of up to 1100 kPa. Thanks to the unique characteristics of the hybrid dielectric, this device showcases potential applications in various domains including human joint motion analysis, healthcare monitoring, accurate message transmission, and convenient Morse code communication utilizing non-overlapping capacitance signals. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Flexible pressure–temperature dual parameter sensors that mimic the function of human skin show potential applications in wearable devices and intelligent robots. Simultaneous sensing of pressure and temperature has been realized by obtaining separated signals utilizing independent piezoresistive and thermoelectric sensing mechanisms, respectively. However, temperature variations induced resistance change poses a negative influence on the pressure sensing accuracy. In this study, a flexible pressure–temperature dual parameter sensor with hierarchical porous structure is presented. The conductivity is realized by inserting graphene into a multilayer structured thermoplastic polyurethane/carbon nanofibers (TPU/CNFs) sponge. The hierarchical porous structured TPU/CNFs sponge with graphene coating endows the sensor with a high pressure sensitivity of 0.14 kPa−1 (0–60 kPa) and a high temperature sensitivity of 30.8 μV/K. Moreover, in the dual parameter mode, the sensor demonstrates neglectable mutual interference between pressure and temperature signals due to lowered temperature-induced resistance change by surface coating of graphene. We show that the sensor can be integrated inside the mask to monitor real-time human respiration. It is also used as the sensing part of a robot arm for high temperature alarm and automatic evacuation. The excellent performance of the sensor ensures its promising application in healthcare monitoring, prosthesis and human–machine interaction (HMI) systems. © 2021

AB  - Background: Parkinson disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with a variety of motor and nonmotor symptoms. Many of these symptoms can be monitored by eHealth solutions, including smartphone apps, wearable sensors, and camera systems. The usability of such systems is a key factor in long-term use, but not much is known about the predictors of successful use and preferable methods to assess usability in patients with PD. Objective: This study tested methods to assess usability and determined prerequisites for successful use in patients with PD. Methods: We performed comprehensive usability assessments with 18 patients with PD using a mixed methods usability battery containing the System Usability Scale, a rater-based evaluation of device-specific tasks, and qualitative interviews. Each patient performed the usability battery with 2 of 3 randomly assigned devices: a tablet app, wearable sensors, and a camera system. The usability battery was administered at the beginning and at the end of a 4-day testing period. Between usability batteries, the systems were used by the patients during 3 sessions of motor assessments (wearable sensors and camera system) and at the movement disorder ward (tablet app). Results: In this study, the rater-based evaluation of tasks discriminated the best between the 3 eHealth solutions, whereas subjective modalities such as the System Usability Scale were not able to distinguish between the systems. Successful use was associated with different clinical characteristics for each system: eHealth literacy and cognitive function predicted successful use of the tablet app, and better motor function and lower age correlated with the independent use of the camera system. The successful use of the wearable sensors was independent of clinical characteristics. Unfortunately, patients who were not able to use the devices well provided few improvement suggestions in qualitative interviews. Conclusions: eHealth solutions should be developed with a specific set of patients in mind and subsequently tested in this cohort. For a complete picture, usability assessments should include a rater-based evaluation of task performance, and there is a need to develop strategies to circumvent the underrepresentation of poorly performing patients in qualitative usability research. © Jonas Bendig, Anja Spanz, Jana Leidig, Anika Frank, Marcus Stahr, Heinz Reichmann, Kai F Loewenbrück, Björn H Falkenburger.

AB  - High-performance wearable electronics show great potential in the soft robotics, artificial intelligence, human–machine interaction, health care, etc. Due to the wide application in heart rate detection, voice monitoring, and sports data collection, the pressure sensor has grasped a lot of attention. However, poor cycle stability, low sensitivity and narrow working pressure range hinder the further development of the pressure sensors. To solve the above mentioned problems, a polyurethane-based conductive sponge is prepared via silver nanoparticle coating after the in-situ synthesis of poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) on the backbones of polyurethane foam. The flexible pressure sensor exhibits excellent performance, including ultrahigh sensitivity (3.039 kPa−1), wide working range (0–35 kPa), frequency-independent performance, reliable repeatability (~ 1000 cycles), rapid and stable response. Finally, we successfully demonstrated these flexible sensors in detecting tiny physiological activities and human motions. All the results demonstrate that the the polyurethane-based pressure sensor is a promising candidate for soft electronics and healthcare monitoring. © 2021, The Polymer Society, Taipei.

AB  - High-performance flexible pressure sensors with high sensitivity and large sensing range are vital components of the system for physiological signals collection, human-machine interaction and artificial intelligence. Herein, a flexible pressure sensor of copper nanowires/reduced graphene oxide/melamine foam (CuRGOMF) was fabricated by coating reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and in-situ growing of copper nanowires (Cu NWs) on the skeleton of melamine foam (MF). The as-prepared sensor features high sensitivity at wide working range (0.011 kPa−1, 0–1.5 kPa; 0.088 kPa−1, 1.5–10 kPa and 0.024kPa−1, 10–18 kPa) and cyclic stability (5000 cycles). The human motions of finger bending, grasping, clicking the mouse and picking up/dropping objects can be successfully detected in real-time based on the CuRGOMF sensor. The CuRGOMF sensor illustrates a promising candidate for healthcare monitoring and wearable device in artificial intelligence. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, stretchable and wearable strain sensors with excellent sensing performance are garnering significant research attention owing to their diverse range of application prospects in human activity monitoring, healthcare and biomedical engineering, and human-machine interaction. In this study, Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposites are constructed for strain monitoring and wearable applications. A cost-effective, environmentally benign, and scalable spray coating technique has been utilized to achieve highly conductive functional sensor materials by coating graphite nanoflakes onto the soft, epidermis-like, and highly elastic Rebound silicone elastomers. In strain monitoring, the Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake (GNF)/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposite strain sensors demonstrate high performance with a large strain sensitivity (a maximum gauge factor of 96.73), a wide sensing range of up to 50%, a fast response and recovery speed (160 ms), high linearity, and prominent durability (more than 850 stretching-releasing cycles under an extensive tensile deformation of 15% strain). As a result, the Rebound silicone elastomer/graphite nanoflake/Rebound silicone elastomer sandwich structured nanocomposite strain sensor demonstrates attractive prospects in precision measurements of all frequencies of human activities, including tiny mechanical deformations (facial expressions, eye activities, blood flow pulse, and vibration of the vocal cords) and large-strain human joint movements (bending process of a finger, and wrist, elbow, and knee bending), hence exhibiting substantial potential in human activity monitoring as well as biomedical engineering. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Ever-evolving advances in flexible magnetic sensors are promising to fuel technological developments in the fields of touchless human-machine interaction, implantable medical diagnosis, and magnetoreception for artificial intelligence. However, the realization of highly flexible and extremely sensitive magnetic sensors remains a challenge. Here, we report a cost-effective, flexible, and ultra-sensitive heterostructural magnetoelectric (ME) sensor consisting of piezoelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) thick films and Metglas foils. The flexible sensor exhibits a strong ME coefficient of 19.3 V cm-1 Oe-1 at low frequencies and 280.5 V cm-1 Oe-1 at resonance due to the exceptionally high piezoelectric coefficient d33 ∼72 pC N-1 of the constituent PZT thick films. The flexible ME sensor possesses not only ultrahigh sensitivities of 200 nT at low frequencies and 200 pT at resonance but also shows an excellent mechanical endurance. Through 5000 bending cycles (radii of ∼1 cm), the sensors showed no fatigue-induced performance degradation. This ultrasensitive flexible sensor provides a platform capable of sensing and responding to external magnetic fields and will find applications in soft robotics, wearable healthcare monitoring, and consumer electronics.  © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - The surge in popularity of wireless headphones, particularly wireless earbuds, as smart wearables, has been notable in recent years. These devices, empowered by artificial intelligence (AI), are broadening their utility in areas such as speech recognition, augmented reality, pose recognition, and health care monitoring, thereby enriching user experiences through novel interactive interfaces driven by embedded sensors. However, the widespread adoption of wireless earbuds has spurred concerns regarding security and privacy, necessitating robust bespoke security measures. Despite the miniaturization of mobile chips enabling the integration of sophisticated algorithms into smart wearables, the research and industrial communities have yet to accord adequate attention to earbud security. This article focuses on empowering wireless earbuds to authenticate their legitimate users, tackling the challenges associated with conventional authentication methods. Instead of relying on input interface authentication methods like PIN or lock patterns, this research delves into leveraging inertial measurement unit (IMU) data collected during interactions with devices to extract novel biometric features, presenting an alternative approach that nonetheless confronts challenges related to signal capture and interference. Consequently, we propose and design BudsAuth, an implicit user authentication framework that harnesses built-in IMU sensors in smart earbuds to capture vibration signals induced by on-face touching interactions with the earbuds. These vibrations are utilized to deliver continuous and implicit user authentication with high precision and compatibility across various earbud models. Extensive evaluation demonstrates BudsAuth's capability to achieve an equal error rate (EER) of 0.0003, representing an approximate 99.97% accuracy with seven consecutive samples of interactive gestures for implicit authentication.  © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible wearable pressure sensors with high sensitivity have a wide range of applications in the field of healthcare monitoring, e-skin technology, robotic limbs, and other human–machine interaction under low pressures. For very low pressures, a sensor with high sensitivity and bulky, expensive measuring equipment is required to obtain the output signal. The incorporation of a micro-pyramidal porous dielectric section can considerably enhance the sensitivity of the capacitance-based pressure sensor. This article has employed a finite element method-based three-dimensional simulation to assess the performance of the porous microstructured capacitive pressure sensor (pmcps). The numerical results revealed a high level of agreement with the experimental data. To simplify the design and fabrication of the sensor with optimal performance, the effects of parameters such as sensor dielectric constant, dielectric layer porosity, base length, tip width, height, and inter-microstructural spacing of porous micro-pyramids were investigated using the response surface methodology. Sensitivity analysis showed that the tip width of the micro-pyramid has the greatest effect on sensor sensitivity and the least effect on the initial capacitance. Finally, equations were proposed for predicting the initial capacitance and sensor sensitivity based on the geometric parameters of the porous micro-pyramid and intrinsic properties of the dielectric section using three-dimensional finite element simulation to facilitate the ability to predict the fabrication and design process of the pmcps and optimize its performance for different applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Flexible wearable electronics were developed for applications such as electronic skins, human-machine interactions, healthcare monitoring, and anti-infection therapy. But conventional materials showed impermeability, single sensing ability, and no designated therapy, which hindered their applications. Thus it was still a great challenge to develop electronic devices with multifunctional sensing properties and self-driven anti-infection therapy. Herein, flexible and breathable on-skin electronic devices for multifunctional fabric based sensing and self-driven designated anti-infection therapy were prepared successfully with cellulose nanocrystals/iron(III) ion/polyvinyl alcohol (CNC/Fe3+/PVA) composite. The resultant composite films possessed robust mechanical performances, outstanding conductivity, and distinguished breathability (3.03 kg/(m2·d)), which benefited from the multiple interactions of weak hydrogen bonds and Fe3+ chelation and synergistic effects among CNC, polyaniline (PANI), and PVA. Surprisingly, the film could be assembled as a multifunctional sensor to actively monitor real-time physical and infection related signals such as temperature, moisture, pH, NH3, and human movements even at sweat states. More importantly, this multifunctional device could act as a self-driven therapist to eliminate bacterial by the release of Fe3+, which was driven by the damage of metal coordination Fe-O bonds due to the high temperature caused by infection at wound sites. Thus, the composite films had potential versatile applications in electronic skins, smart wound dressings, human-machine interactions, and self-driven anti-infection therapy.

AB  - This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Flexible, wearable and breathable pressure sensors have received tremendous interest for various potential applications in wearable electronic skins, intelligent robotics, healthcare biomonitoring, and artificial intelligence. However, it remains a critical challenge to simultaneously achieve high sensitivity, broad sensing range, excellent mechanical stability, fast response/recovery, and reliable breathability for long-term wearing for ultrasensitive comfortable full-scale biomonitoring. Herein, we present a wearable, highly sensitive, broad-range and breathable pressure sensor by sandwiching the interconnected nanocomposites of carbonized metal-organic framework (C-MOF) and polyaniline nanofiber (PANIF) on polyurethane (PU) sponge (C-MOF/PANIF@PU) between a breathable fabric and an interdigitated electrode-coated fabric. The assembled sensor exhibits a broad sensing range (up to 60 kPa), high sensitivity (158.26 kPa−1), fast response/recovery time (22 ms/20 ms), reliable breathability, wireless biomonitoring, and an excellent repeatability over 15,000 cycles. It can be assembled as smart artificial electronic skins (E-skins) for mapping tactile stimuli. This work paves the way for the design of wearable, breathable, highly sensitive and broad-range pressure sensor with potential versatile applications in next-generation artificial skins, personal healthcare monitoring, clinical diagnosis, and human-machine interactions. © 2020
