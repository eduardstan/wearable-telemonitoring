   abstract = {Pandemic situation such as COVID-19 boosted the demand for remote patient monitoring (RPM) system. The medical sensors attached to the human body in RPM system experience varying channel quality due to body movements. This paper analyzes the signal received from RPM sensors when a patient rotates by different angles while sitting on a chair as well as heed the use of a relay node placed on his/her body. Literature suggests many relay-based communication protocols to deliver physio-signals efficiently in an RPM application. However, limited studies have focused on the position of a relay node on the human body. In this paper, we empirically analyze the off-body communication path of sensor nodes by collecting data from different body orientations in a residential room. We estimate the path loss parameters for underweight, normal and overweight body mass index (BMI) categories. The estimated parameters are then used to simulate the physical layer of a home-based indoor RPM application. We inspect different relay node positions on the human body and allude an optimal position of the relay node that cover the transmission range of all sensors and provides an improved channel quality. We improve the Quality of Service (QoS) during non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situation and design an adaptive cross-layer communication protocol for WBANs.},

   abstract = {Integrating sensory devices with wireless power transfer technology for remote sensing (RS) requires the implementation of complex electronic circuitry and communication protocols. To overcome this challenge and remotely monitor mechanical force, we directly integrated piezo-responsive porous multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposites with a near-field wireless power transfer system. The wireless system transfers power bidirectionally between the transmitter and the sensing receiver at the resonant frequency of 13.56 MHz. The detection principle is based on the mechanical force-induced impedance changes in the receiver circuit. The modulated impedance signal is detected wirelessly at the transmitter circuit via a full-bridge rectifier and a smoothing capacitor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the wireless monitoring of finger bending and applied force using our flexible and disposable sensor without using any energy storage devices. The results suggest a response and recovery time of 400 ± 50 ms, strain sensitivity of 24.73, and pressure sensitivity of 0.98. Our approach adds a new path for disposable haptic-based sensory applications that do not require complex communication protocols in medical, robotics, and other fields.},

The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

In large scale and general perspective, the effective parameters from behavioral, ambient, and physiological domains as the most influencing fields of interest in healthcare must be monitored. In personalized healthcare monitoring, wearables are playing an important role in terms of data measurement and collection. We aim at creating a configurable and adaptable platform for comprehensive parameters monitoring, according to the convenient mode of wearability. Hence, we develop an innovative wrist-worn prototype for ambient monitoring and a flexible IoT gateway. The prototype measures the most critical parameters from an ambient domain. In this platform, via IoT gateway as an intermediate hub between the wearables and the IoT server, bidirectional communication between the end user and medics is established in real time. In addition, the physician as the real-time observer of patients are given the possibility to set up the required parameters for measurement through the IoT gateway and activate/deactivate the sensors on the wearables. Therefore, depending on the target investigation, status of patients, requirements, and demands, medics can determine the setup parameters for measurement. Thus, the application of this platform is not limited to specific groups, but widely may be applied whether in daily routine or medical research investigation. Under the flexible IoT gateway, the new wearables can readily be integrated and synchronized into the platform. The users are not restricted to select only one specific product but there are alternatives as well. To support the solution, experimental results are provided.},

   abstract = {Developments in information and related technologies have led to a wider use of the Internet of things (IoT). By integrating both virtual and physical worlds, IoT creates an integrated communication framework of interrelated things and operating systems. With the advent of IoT systems based on digital remote care, transferring medical data is becoming a daily routine. Healthcare is one of the most popular IoT applications and tries to monitor patients' vital signs during the day for weeks and to eliminate the need for hospitalization. In a healthcare system, many sensors are installed to collect the patient's information, including environmental monitoring sensors and vital and unstructured message sensors in order to reduce the patients' expenses. The IoT network contains flexible sensors in dynamically changing environments where sensors collect environmental information and send it to nursing stations for healthcare applications. Due to the wireless nature of IoT networks, secure data transmission in the healthcare context is very important. Data collected from sensors embedded in healthcare devices may be lost for various reasons along the transmission path. Therefore, establishing a secure communication path in IoT networks in the context of healthcare is of great importance. In this paper, in order to provide a reliable data transfer protocol in the context of healthcare, a reliable routing using multiobjective genetic algorithm (RRMOGA) method is presented. The contribution of this paper can be summarized in two steps: (i) using a multiobjective optimization approach to find near-optimal paths and (ii) using reliable agents in the network to find backup paths. The simulation outcomes reveal that the proposed approach, based on the use of the multiobjective optimization approach, tries to find optimal paths for information transfer that improve the main parameters of the network. Also, the use of secure agents leads to a secure information transfer in the network in the context of healthcare. Experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved reliability and data delivery rates, 99% and 99.9%, respectively. The proposed method has improved network lifetime, delivery rate, and delay by 14%, 2%, and 5.6%, respectively.  © 2021 Saeed Javid and Abbas Mirzaei.},

In an SoS environment, the entire system is divided into sub-systems, which provides more flexibility and reduces the management cost of the entire system. SoS have been widely used in healthcare monitoring services, where patients are provided with medical sensors that send their medical measurements to a remote unit for further processing and decision-making. These sensors communicate with an access point using the wireless channel, which gives patients flexibility in mobility and makes the monitoring system more convenient and comfortable. However, sending data over the wireless channel presents several challenges, such as contention between the different sensors in accessing the channel and the bit errors associated with the noisy wireless channel. In this paper, an SoS healthcare monitoring framework is proposed, where a wireless communication protocol is proposed that addresses the sensors' node network access contention and mitigates the bit errors of the communication channel by providing forward error correction bits to the transmitted packets. In addition, the protocol takes into consideration the sensors' importance and criticality, such that more important sensors are given more network access time and more error correction bits, which in turn results in a robust transmission process with low transmission delay. The simulation results show the proposed wireless communication protocol's effectiveness in lowering the packet loss, giving higher priority and having higher throughput for the more critical sensors. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) provide wireless remote patient monitoring services where doctors get patients' health records without physically visiting them. In WBANs, biosensors are placed on the patient's body that sense and transmit physiological data to the paired medical personnel. Such medical setups are appropriate for COVID-19 patient monitoring, where the patient remains isolated for an extended period. Sometimes, human body parts impede the signals transmitted by biosensors to the coordinator and this type of occlusion lasts for a longer duration during sleeping human postures. In such circumstances, an intermediate biosensor forwards the signals of the occluded biosensor node. The forwarding of messages results in quick depletion of energy resources at the intermediate biosensor, affecting the overall WBAN services. To resolve this, first, we propose an adaptive Relay-Node Centric (RNC) relay-based communication protocol for WBANs, which reduces energy used in relaying and improves the stability period of the network. Second, we design a novel simulation model using an existing real-life experimental dataset to simulate a WBAN placed on the sleeping patient's body. We derive a Discrete Markov Chain (DTMC) model from real-life data and use human biomechanisms to simulate biosensors' connectivity status in four human sleeping positions. Lastly, we evaluate the performance of RNC against the existing cost-function-based and Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) based relay selection protocols. Results obtained on the real-life dataset and designed simulation model show that RNC outperforms the existing methods in terms of network stability period and packet success ratio. © 2022},

Current solutions are invasive or obtrusive and thus not suitable for prolonged monitoring outside the clinical setting. Previous studies demonstrated the feasibility of deriving fB by measuring inclination changes due to breathing using accelerometers or inertial measurement units (IMU). Nevertheless, few studies faced the problem of motion artifacts that limit the use of IMU-based systems for continuous monitoring. Moreover, few attempts have been made to move towards real portability and wearability of such devices. This paper proposes a wearable IMU-based device that communicates via Bluetooth with a smartphone, uploading data on a web server to allow remote monitoring. Two IMU units are placed on thorax and abdomen to record breathing-related movements, while a third IMU unit records body/trunk motion and is used as reference. The performance of the proposed system was evaluated in terms of long-acquisition-platform reliability showing good performances in terms of duration and data loss amount. The device was preliminarily tested in terms of accuracy in breathing temporal parameter measurement, in static condition, during postural changes, and during slight indoor activities showing favorable comparison against the reference methods (mean error breathing frequency < 5%).

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to introduce a wearable solution and a low-complexity algorithm for real-time continuous ambulatory respiratory monitoring. Methods: A wearable chest patch is designed using a bioimpedance (BioZ) sensor to measure the changes in chest impedance caused by breathing. Besides, a medical-grade infrared temperature sensor is utilized to monitor body temperature. The computing algorithm implemented on the patch enables computation of breath-by-breath respiratory rate and chest temperature in real-time. Two wireless communication protocols are included in the system, namely Bluetooth and Long Range (LoRa), which enable both short-range and long-range data transmission. Results: The breathing rate measured in static (i.e., standing, sitting, supine, and lateral lying) and dynamic (i.e., walking, running, and cycling) positions by our device yielded an accuracy of more than 97.8% and 98.5% relative to the ground truth, respectively. Additionally, the device's performance is evaluated in real-world scenarios both indoors and outdoors. Conclusion: The proposed system is capable of measuring breathing rate throughout a variety of daily activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BioZ-based wearable patch capable of detecting breath-by-breath respiratory rate in real-time remotely under unrestricted ambulatory conditions. Significance: This study establishes a strategy for continuous respiratory monitoring that could aid in the early detection of cardiopulmonary disorders in everyday life.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Over the past two periods, advancements in communication technology have exploded, with the last decade seeing an unprecedented explosion in the production of numerous cutting-edge, handheld and small communication devices. Modern, high-speed wireless communication technologies that employ complex network and communication protocols and standards have quickly supplanted the traditional wired scheme of communication. Wireless medical sensor networks are a promising application of WSNs in healthcare since they allow for remote patient monitoring (WMSNs). Reliable patient communication, patient mobility, and energy-efficient routing are at the forefront of current WMSN healthcare research developments. Nonetheless, patients' personal information is at risk when new technologies are implemented in healthcare applications without proper security measures being taken. In this study, we present a privacy-preserving strategy for the secure transfer of medical records over WSNs by combining secret sharing, and hashing. The healthcare information gathered by a wireless sensor network is broken down into subsets. In addition, a popular hashing algorithm is used to determine a unique identifier for each constituent. Any alterations to the message will result in a different hash value. Multipath routing is then used to send these parts to the servers. In order to verify the efficacy of the new method, this paper presents comprehensive simulations. The results indicate that secret splitting, in conjunction with multipath routing, aids in the maintenance of confidentiality in a wireless sensor network-based healthcare scheme.},

@article{Smiley2023,
   abstract = {Purpose: This paper focuses on developing and testing three versions of interactive bike (iBikE) interfaces for remote monitoring and control of cycling exercise sessions to promote upper and lower limb rehabilitation. Methods: Two versions of the system, which consisted of a portable bike and a tablet PC, were designed to communicate through either Bluetooth low energy (BLE) or Wi-Fi interfaces for real-time monitoring of exercise progress by both the users and their clinical team. The third version of the iBikE system consisted of a motorized bike and a tablet PC. It utilized conventional Bluetooth to implement remote control of the motorized bike’s speed during an exercise session as well as to provide real-time visualization of the exercise progress. We developed three customized tablet PC apps with similar user interfaces but different communication protocols for all the platforms to provide a graphical representation of exercise progress. The same microcontroller unit (MCU), ESP-32, was used in all the systems. Results: Each system was tested in 1-minute exercise sessions at various speeds. To evaluate the accuracy of the measured data, in addition to reading speed values from the iBikE app, the cycling speed of the bikes was measured continuously using a tachometer. The mean differences of averaged RPMs for both data sets were calculated. The calculated values were 0.38 ± 0.03, 0.25 ± 0.27, and 6.7 ± 3.3 for the BLE system, the Wi-Fi system, and the conventional Bluetooth system, respectively. Conclusion: All interfaces provided sufficient accuracy for use in telerehabilitation.},
