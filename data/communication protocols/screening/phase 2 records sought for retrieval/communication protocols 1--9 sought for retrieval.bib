   abstract = {This article describes the design, development and implementation of a set of microservices based on an architecture that enables detection and assisted clinical diagnosis within the field of infectious diseases of elderly patients, via a telemonitoring system. The proposed system is designed to continuously update a medical database fed with vital signs from biosensor kits applied by nurses to elderly people on a daily basis. The database is hosted in the cloud and is managed by a flexible microservices software architecture. The computational paradigms of the edge and the cloud were used in the implementation of a hybrid cloud architecture in order to support versatile high-performance applications under the microservices pattern for the pre-diagnosis of infectious diseases in elderly patients. The results of an analysis of the usability of the equipment, the performance of the architecture and the service concept show that the proposed e-health system is feasible and innovative. The system components are also selected to give a cost-effective implementation for people living in disadvantaged areas. The proposed e-health system is also suitable for distributed computing, big data and NoSQL structures, thus allowing the immediate application of machine learning and AI algorithms to discover knowledge patterns from the overall population.},

   abstract = {System-of-systems (SoS) have recently been used in several applications and scenarios in the field of safety, defense, and healthcare. In an SoS environment, the entire system is divided into sub-systems, which provides more flexibility and reduces the management cost of the entire system. SoS have been widely used in healthcare monitoring services, where patients are provided with medical sensors that send their medical measurements to a remote unit for further processing and decision-making. These sensors communicate with an access point using the wireless channel, which gives patients flexibility in mobility and makes the monitoring system more convenient and comfortable. However, sending data over the wireless channel presents several challenges, such as contention between the different sensors in accessing the channel and the bit errors associated with the noisy wireless channel. In this paper, an SoS healthcare monitoring framework is proposed, where a wireless communication protocol is proposed that addresses the sensors' node network access contention and mitigates the bit errors of the communication channel by providing forward error correction bits to the transmitted packets. In addition, the protocol takes into consideration the sensors' importance and criticality, such that more important sensors are given more network access time and more error correction bits, which in turn results in a robust transmission process with low transmission delay. The simulation results show the proposed wireless communication protocol's effectiveness in lowering the packet loss, giving higher priority and having higher throughput for the more critical sensors. © 2013 IEEE.},

   abstract = {The concentration in the new era of healthcare is the medical Internet of Things (IoT) according to preventive and prediction (p2Health). In large scale and general perspective, the effective parameters from behavioral, ambient, and physiological domains as the most influencing fields of interest in healthcare must be monitored. In personalized healthcare monitoring, wearables are playing an important role in terms of data measurement and collection. We aim at creating a configurable and adaptable platform for comprehensive parameters monitoring, according to the convenient mode of wearability. Hence, we develop an innovative wrist-worn prototype for ambient monitoring and a flexible IoT gateway. The prototype measures the most critical parameters from an ambient domain. In this platform, via IoT gateway as an intermediate hub between the wearables and the IoT server, bidirectional communication between the end user and medics is established in real time. In addition, the physician as the real-time observer of patients are given the possibility to set up the required parameters for measurement through the IoT gateway and activate/deactivate the sensors on the wearables. Therefore, depending on the target investigation, status of patients, requirements, and demands, medics can determine the setup parameters for measurement. Thus, the application of this platform is not limited to specific groups, but widely may be applied whether in daily routine or medical research investigation. Under the flexible IoT gateway, the new wearables can readily be integrated and synchronized into the platform. The users are not restricted to select only one specific product but there are alternatives as well. To support the solution, experimental results are provided.},

   abstract = {Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

The medical sensors attached to the human body in RPM system experience varying channel quality due to body movements. This paper analyzes the signal received from RPM sensors when a patient rotates by different angles while sitting on a chair as well as heed the use of a relay node placed on his/her body. Literature suggests many relay-based communication protocols to deliver physio-signals efficiently in an RPM application. However, limited studies have focused on the position of a relay node on the human body. In this paper, we empirically analyze the off-body communication path of sensor nodes by collecting data from different body orientations in a residential room. We estimate the path loss parameters for underweight, normal and overweight body mass index (BMI) categories. The estimated parameters are then used to simulate the physical layer of a home-based indoor RPM application. We inspect different relay node positions on the human body and allude an optimal position of the relay node that cover the transmission range of all sensors and provides an improved channel quality. We improve the Quality of Service (QoS) during non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situation and design an adaptive cross-layer communication protocol for WBANs.},

   abstract = {Integrating sensory devices with wireless power transfer technology for remote sensing (RS) requires the implementation of complex electronic circuitry and communication protocols. To overcome this challenge and remotely monitor mechanical force, we directly integrated piezo-responsive porous multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposites with a near-field wireless power transfer system. The wireless system transfers power bidirectionally between the transmitter and the sensing receiver at the resonant frequency of 13.56 MHz. The detection principle is based on the mechanical force-induced impedance changes in the receiver circuit. The modulated impedance signal is detected wirelessly at the transmitter circuit via a full-bridge rectifier and a smoothing capacitor. Furthermore, we demonstrate the wireless monitoring of finger bending and applied force using our flexible and disposable sensor without using any energy storage devices. The results suggest a response and recovery time of 400 ± 50 ms, strain sensitivity of 24.73, and pressure sensitivity of 0.98. Our approach adds a new path for disposable haptic-based sensory applications that do not require complex communication protocols in medical, robotics, and other fields.},

   abstract = {Objective: This paper aims to introduce a wearable solution and a low-complexity algorithm for real-time continuous ambulatory respiratory monitoring. Methods: A wearable chest patch is designed using a bioimpedance (BioZ) sensor to measure the changes in chest impedance caused by breathing. Besides, a medical-grade infrared temperature sensor is utilized to monitor body temperature. The computing algorithm implemented on the patch enables computation of breath-by-breath respiratory rate and chest temperature in real-time. Two wireless communication protocols are included in the system, namely Bluetooth and Long Range (LoRa), which enable both short-range and long-range data transmission. Results: The breathing rate measured in static (i.e., standing, sitting, supine, and lateral lying) and dynamic (i.e., walking, running, and cycling) positions by our device yielded an accuracy of more than 97.8% and 98.5% relative to the ground truth, respectively. Additionally, the device's performance is evaluated in real-world scenarios both indoors and outdoors. Conclusion: The proposed system is capable of measuring breathing rate throughout a variety of daily activities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first BioZ-based wearable patch capable of detecting breath-by-breath respiratory rate in real-time remotely under unrestricted ambulatory conditions. Significance: This study establishes a strategy for continuous respiratory monitoring that could aid in the early detection of cardiopulmonary disorders in everyday life.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

Our system offers certain advantages when compared to other similar solutions, allowing remote symptom and health monitoring that can be applied to isolated or quarantined people, without any external interaction with the patient. The IoT wearable device can monitor parameters of health condition like pulse, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature, as well as the current location. To test the performance of the proposed system, two persons under quarantine were monitored, for a complete 14-day standard quarantine time interval. Based on the data transmitted to the monitoring center, the medical staff decided, after several days of monitoring, when the measured values were outside of the normal parameters, to do an RT-PCR test for one of the two persons, confirming the SARS-CoV2 virus infection. We have to emphasize the high degree of scalability of the proposed solution that can oversee a large number of patients at the same time, thanks to the LoRaWAN communication protocol used.

This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.},
