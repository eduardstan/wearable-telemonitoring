   abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have been applied to various fields such as manufacturing, automobile industry and healthcare. IoT-based healthcare has a significant impact on real-time remote monitoring of patients’ health and consequently improving treatments and reducing healthcare costs. In fact, IoT has made healthcare more reliable, efficient, and accessible. Two major drawbacks which IoT suffers from can be expressed as: first, the limited battery capacity of the sensors is quickly depleted due to the continuous stream of data; second, the dependence of the system on the cloud for computations and processing causes latency in data transmission which is not accepted in real-time monitoring applications. This research is conducted to develop a real-time, secure, and energy-efficient platform which provides a solution for reducing computation load on the cloud and diminishing data transmission delay. In the proposed platform, the sensors utilize a state-of-the-art power saving technique known as Compressive Sensing (CS). CS allows sensors to retrieve the sensed data using fewer measurements by sending a compressed signal. In this framework, the signal reconstruction and processing are computed locally on a Heterogeneous Multicore Platform (HMP) device to decrease the dependency on the cloud. In addition, a framework has been implemented to control the system, set different parameters, display the data as well as send live notifications to medical experts through the cloud in order to alert them of any eventual hazardous event or abnormality and allow quick interventions. Finally, a case study of the system is presented demonstrating the acquisition and monitoring of the data for a given subject in real-time. The obtained results reveal that the proposed solution reduces 15.4% of energy consumption in sensors, that makes this prototype a good candidate for IoT employment in healthcare.},

   abstract = {Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

   abstract = {Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients. © 2020 Yu-Pin Chen.},

   abstract = {Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

   abstract = {This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.},

Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.},

   abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic and discovery of new mutant strains have a devastating impact worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like situations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

In France, there are several pathways for medical devices to enter the market, from diagnosis-related group tariffs to reimbursement lists. However, traditional regulatory pathways can delay market access for innovative technologies. In response, France has established Early Access Programs to expedite patient access to medical devices. This paper looks at three of these Early Access Programs for medical devices. Innovation Funding, introduced in its final version in 2015, provides temporary coverage for innovative devices and facilitates data collection for informed funding decisions. Transitional Coverage (PECT), established in 2021, targets CE-marked devices for rare or serious conditions. Transitional coverage for digital health applications (PECAN), introduced in 2022, covers digital medical devices, either therapeutic or for patient monitoring. Innovation funding has been granted to 16 technologies out of 35 applications (46%) since 2015. 6 technologies out of 11 (64%) applications benefit from PECT. PECAN, in its first year, has granted a telemonitoring solution with a favourable opinion.

However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.},

post-stroke functional recovery, but is associated with resource
and accessibility barriers. This study evaluated the combination
of a wearable device-assisted system (WEAR) and conventional
therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation. METHODS: This randomized,
controlled, parallel group, clinical trial was conducted at two
rehabilitation centers. A WEAR system was developed featuring
sensors and application program-embedded smartphones. Stroke
patients within 12 weeks of onset and modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
scores of 2 to 4 were randomized into a wearable group (WG, WEAR
+ conventional rehabilitation) or control group (CG, conventional
rehabilitation) for 90 days. The primary outcome was mRS score
changes within 90 days. RESULTS: Among 127 stroke patients
enrolled (76 men [59.8%]; mean age: 57.5 years), 63 and 64
patients were randomized to WG and CG, respectively. Both groups
showed significant improvements in mRS scores. Between-group
repeated measures analysis adjusted for sex, age and number of
rehabilitation sessions showed greater improvement in mRS scores
within 90 days in the WG than in the CG (estimate: 0.73).
CONCLUSIONS: This combined WEAR and conventional rehabilitation
approach may improve post-stroke functional recovery compared
with conventional rehabilitation alone. The WEAR system permits

Wearable technology and mobile health platforms can offer remote monitoring capabilities, allowing for real-time virtual programming with optimization of patients' therapy, use of digital biomarkers that can help identify the onset, symptoms, medication-related fluctuations and side-effects, and response to DBS treatment. Through an investigational remote monitoring application (RM app) integrating patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and objective data using wearables, we aimed to develop an accessible, data-driven digital tool to monitor patient symptoms and deliver low-burden and easy-to-access DBS therapy. The platform is designed to be compatible with several consumer-grade wearables and ensures patient data privacy and security. We conducted a feasibility study to test the tool's effectiveness in a large-scale DBS study, where subjects received a home-monitoring kit consisting of an iPhone and Apple Watch, pre-configured with the RM app to enable remote data collection. Compliance in this paper is defined as adherence to the RM app and Apple watch usage. Analysis of 67 subjects from the study demonstrated an average compliance rate of 63.3% for daily check-ins, 85.5% for monthly surveys and 61.9% for passive data with an average of 55 days of post-implant data. The study highlights the feasibility of frequent monitoring in the early post-implant period that could lead to optimal outcomes for patients. The platform developed can further optimize study execution and be extended to other chronic conditions treated with neuromodulation implants such as depression and pain.},

   abstract = {Stride-to-stride fluctuations during walking reflect age-related changes in gait adaptability and are estimated with nonlinear measures that confine data collection to controlled settings. Smartphones, with their embedded accelerometers, may provide accessible gait analysis throughout the day. This study investigated age-related differences in linear and nonlinear gait measures estimated from a smartphone accelerometer (SPAcc) in an unconstrained, free-living environment. Thirteen young adults (YA) and 11 older adults (OA) walked within a shopping mall with a SPAcc placed in their front right pants pocket. The inter-stride interval, calculated as the time difference between ipsilateral heel contacts, was used for dependent measures calculations. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant (p < 0.05) age-related differences (mean: YA, OA) for stride-time standard deviation (0.04 s, 0.05 s) and coefficient of variation (3.47%, 4.16%), sample entropy (SaEn) scale 1 (1.70, 1.86) and scale 3 (2.12, 1.80), and statistical persistence decay (31 strides, 23 strides). The fractal scaling index was not different between groups (0.93, 0.95), but exceeded those typically found in controlled settings, suggesting an upregulation in adaptive behaviour likely to accommodate the increased challenge of free-living walking. These findings support the SPAcc as a viable telehealth instrument for remote monitoring of gait dynamics, with implications for unsupervised fall-risk assessment. © 2024 by the authors.},

   abstract = {The promise of remote patient monitoring (RPM) lies in its ability to revolutionize health care delivery by enabling continuous, real-time tracking of patient health outside traditional clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of RPM, particularly in underserved and rural populations, highlighting both its potential and the persistent barriers that limit its widespread use. This paper explores the critical role of technological advancements—such as wear-ables, artificial intelligence (AI), and broadband expansion—in sustaining and optimizing RPM in the postpandemic era. We examine Michigan as a microcosm of national health care challenges, focusing on its diverse population and geographic barriers, and propose condition-specific RPM protocols to address these inequities. Key facilitators and barriers to RPM implementation are discussed, with a focus on AI integration, community engagement, and digital infrastructure. We also explore the role of policy reform and public–private partnerships in supporting RPM’s scalability and long-term sustainability. Our findings suggest that while RPM offers a powerful tool for improving health care access and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions and rural maternal health, sustained investment in technology and infrastructure is critical. By addressing these challenges, RPM can become a cornerstone of modern health care, reducing disparities and improving care delivery for underserved populations. © MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC.},

   abstract = {Over 80% of maternal deaths are preventable. Telehealth approaches can help address disparities by increasing access to quality maternal health care. In this position statement, we advocate for the utility of telehealth to address maternal mortality disparities, focusing specifically on the postpartum period, where most maternal deaths occur. Specifically, we describe how telehealth visits, mobile health applications, and wearable devices for remote patient monitoring can be used to promote the uptake of postpartum care and adherence to evidence-based treatment for the most common causes of maternal death (i.e., cardiovascular conditions and mental health-related conditions). We discuss challenges that must be overcome to ensure the broad and equitable reach of telehealth and identify specific action steps to address this pressing public health issue.
