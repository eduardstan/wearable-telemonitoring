AB  - The convergence of Internet-based technology with primary care utility is critical for the worldwide amalgamation of quality medical management and its accessibility. Innovation has remained a significant aspect of medical care, allowing physicians to employ a variety of instruments to examine, administer, and observe patients. This paper’s central emphasis is on e-health data collection, conveyance, and surveillance apparatus. The wireless monitoring system monitors patients’ medical metrics and communicates them to the furthest edge via the ZigBee gateway. This paper introduces an IoT-enabled smart e-healthcare system that can continuously monitor patients' vital signs and the real-time room environment where patients are currently positioned. This system collects data from the hospital premises using five sensors: the body temperature sensor, the heartbeat sensor, the room temperature sensor, the CO2 sensor, and the CO sensor. For each situation, the percentage of errors in the developed scheme is less than 2%. The patient's situation is relayed to medical personnel via a portal, where they can monitor, process, and analyze the patient's real-time situation. A low-power communication device and an embedded smart IoT system are being designed and developed with the goal of covertly gathering physiological metrics without interfering with daily life. Sensor-based data analytics using machine learning methods were used in this study to identify predictors and/or sudden abnormality indicators accurately. The data for heart rate and body temperature is analyzed using the bio-medical sensors embedded with an ARM Cortex-A7 microcontroller. For the benchmark accuracy of the dataset, a detailed calculation of experiments in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) with various machine learning techniques is compared. It has been exemplified through extensive testing that the recommended procedure outperforms machine learning methodologies with a 15% increase in accuracy, facilitating rapid alarms to prevent the aftereffects of abnormalities if they occur, which the system without the utilized methodology lags. Cloud storage allows for the analysis of parameters regarding patients. The error between observed and actual data is analyzed to validate the proposed Internet of Medical Things model. The performance of the proposed method is further identified by using various classifications, like decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, and Naive Bayes, for detecting any variation from normal data or disorder on real-time datasets. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - Introduction: Remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED) allows rapid detection of clinical and electrical events. Recently, several smartphone applications have been developed with the aim of improving patient compliance and better interpreting and integrating data deriving from remote control for the management of heart failure (HF). Areas covered: Studies investigating the role of CIEDs’ RM in HF patients to predict and early treat acute decompensation. The importance of new technologies and applications developed to provide crucial information to clinicians, to better manage HF patients. Expert opinion: New medical technologies and smartphone applications for CIEDs’ RM were developed to help clinicians in the management of CIED carriers. Indeed, the accessibility of technological devices (e.g. smartphones) and the improvements in medical technology provide the opportunity to optimize HF patients’ monitoring by the transmission of device-related data, and with direct involvement of patients themselves. Thanks to these advancements, physicians have the possibility to recognize worsening signs of HF and promptly optimize treatments to potentially avoid hospitalization. The great value of this approach is its potential of reducing scheduled in-office visits or unnecessary medical contacts and optimizing healthcare resources management. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Due to the serious impact of falls on the autonomy and health of older people, the investigation of wearable alerting systems for the automatic detection of falls has gained considerable scientific interest in the field of body telemonitoring with wireless sensors. Because of the difficulties of systematically validating these systems in a real application scenario, Fall Detection Systems (FDSs) are typically evaluated by studying their response to datasets containing inertial sensor measurements captured during the execution of labelled nonfall and fall movements. In this context, during the last decade, numerous publicly accessible databases have been released aiming at offering a common benchmarking tool for the validation of the new proposals on FDSs. This work offers a comparative and updated analysis of these existing repositories. For this purpose, the samples contained in the datasets are characterized by different statistics that model diverse aspects of the mobility of the human body in the time interval where the greatest change in the acceleration module is identified. By using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the series of these features, the comparison shows the significant differences detected between the datasets, even when comparing activities that require a similar degree of physical effort. This heterogeneity, which may result from the great variability of the sensors, experimental users, and testbeds employed to generate the datasets, is relevant because it casts doubt on the validity of the conclusions of many studies on FDSs, since most of the proposals in the literature are only evaluated using a single database. © 2020 Eduardo Casilari et al.

AB  - Delayed detection of labor pain in pregnant women, especially during their first delivery, often leads to delays in reaching healthcare facilities, potentially resulting in complications. This research proposes an innovative IoT-enabled system for remote monitoring of labor progress and fetal health, designed specifically to address the needs of women in remote areas within a 100 km radius of healthcare facilities. The system includes a wearable device integrated with sensors to detect the onset of labor pain and continuously monitor the fetal heartbeat. Upon detecting labor pain, the system automatically sends an alert to the medical team, allowing timely intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy with a 99.2% accuracy in detecting labor onset and a 98.5% reliability in fetal heartbeat monitoring. The latency for alert transmission was measured at an average of 3.2 seconds, ensuring prompt notification to healthcare providers. The proposed solution enhances accessibility to maternal care, reduces complications due to delayed hospital admission, and provides continuous fetal monitoring, even in resource-constrained environments. This innovation bridges the gap in maternal healthcare delivery for underserved regions, offering a practical, cost-effective, and scalable solution. © IJCESEN.

AB  - The flexible and wearable capacitive pressure sensors are widely used in healthcare monitoring, robotics manufacture and military equipment. These types of highly sensitive pressure sensors can be realized by designing micro-structure electrodes or dielectric layers on a wearable smart device. Herein, we prepare a flexible and conductive electrode through electrospinning of palladium ions (Pd2+)/polyacrylonitrile (PAN) solution and followed by electroless plating of the hybrid nanofibrous membranes. The FESEM images showed that the obtained conductive nanofibrous membrane was covered by a coral-like silver layer with porosity benefiting for excellent electrical conductivity. Based on the superior performance, it is used as the electrodes and jointly assembled into a full microporous structure sensor with the high-mesh nylon netting. Benefitting from the dramatically alterable contact area of the electrode and the good dielectricity of nylon netting, the as-prepared sensor exhibits a high sensitivity of 1.49 kPa−1, a fast response time of 48 ms, low hysteresis of 7.55% and stable durability over 1000 cycles. Besides, practical human motions’ detection is carried out by this wearable pressure sensor. The simulation of the finite elemental analysis is used to explain the mechanism of the sensor. This fabrication method is facile, low-cost, and less metal pollution, which may provide an insight to design microstructures for improving the performance, and imply an accessible prospect in the industrialization of sensors. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to assess the experiences, barriers, and expectations regarding current patient monitoring systems among intensive care unit nurses at one university hospital. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study approach was adopted to test the research questions. Results: Intensive care unit personnel placed a high value on practical criteria such as user friendliness and visualization while assessing the present monitoring system. Poor alarm handling was recognized as possible patient safety hazards. The necessity of high accessibility was highlighted once again for a prospective system; wireless, noninvasive, and interoperability of monitoring devices were requested; and smart phones for distant patient monitoring and alert management improvement were required. Conclusion: Core comments from ICU personnel are included in this qualitative research on patient monitoring. All national healthcare involved parties must focus more on user-derived insights to ensure a speedy and effective introduction of digital health technologies in the ICU. The findings from the alarm control or mobile device studies might be utilized to train ICU personnel to use new technology, minimize alarm fatigue, increase medical device accessibility, and develop interoperability standards in critical care practice. 2024 Rayan, Al-Ghabeesh, Fawaz, Behar and Toumi.

AB  - By facilitating the modification of a particular health condition under certain circumstances, personalised healthcare services usually function in the most stringent manner. Patient Healthcare Services Monitoring (PHSM) is an interconnected system of all accessible health services that allows for the quick exchange of data over the Internet. Data collection and processing are the backbone of every PHSM program. The incorporation of machine learning algorithms into PHSM-IoT is crucial because of the massive amounts of data stored in healthcare and the great need of precise forecasts. By combining the data collected by the sensors with programs that make sense of it, medical professionals and hospitals may monitor patients for any irregularities and then use that information to make diagnoses and recommendations for treatment. The list of possible uses for machine learning in healthcare is almost boundless as well. This article presents the results of an experimental study of healthcare datasets applying machine learning methods, as well as an investigation of IoT based healthcare applications. © 2024, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Mobile and wearable technologies offer patients with diabetes mellitus new possibilities for data collection and their more effective analysis. The Diabesdagboga smartphone application and the Diani web portal enable to collect and analyze glycaemia values, carbohydrates intake, insulin doses and the level of physical activity. The data are not only accessible in the corresponding smartphone but also automatically transferred to an Internet portal, where they may be completed by the records from an electronic pedometer and continuous glucose monitor. All these data may then be displayed in various types of graphical outputs and are available to both the patient and the physician. The case report of a patient who has used the system for almost two years shows a significant improvement in metabolic compensation (a decrease in the mean HbA1c value by 18.6 mmol/mol as compared with the previous period).

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) development made it possible for technology to communicate physical education by connecting cost-effective heterogeneous devices and digital applications to uncontrolled and accessible environments. The traditional physical education monitoring environment creates crucial manual efforts on athletes' activity observations and tracking consistently. Similarly, remote monitoring and assessment of athletes in sports training seem to be barriers to physical education monitoring and training. It creates various chances to improve training and education through technology advancements like IoT and deep learning. Students can efficiently monitor their physical behavior to increase their physical and psychological benefits. The IoT-assisted physical activity monitoring device is proposed to track students' physical activity and enhance outcomes. The management ability allows students to organize and increase speed their physical activity in a wellness manner. In addition, this study examines the connections between monitoring ability which is an essential component for sports activities and physical activity. This system collects essential information from IoT-based wearable devices that interact with the data in real time by virtualizing the device. The IoT network includes several device activities and monitors the heartbeat and physical body temperature of a person. The analysis of specific studies and student feedback shows that the designed virtual system of physical educations is effective in its application and implementation and provides a reliable guide for developing student physical educational systems.

AB  - Background: Mental health conditions have become a substantial cause of disability worldwide, resulting in economic burden and strain on the public health system. Incorporating cognitive and physiological biomarkers using noninvasive sensors combined with self-reported questionnaires can provide a more accurate characterization of the individual’s well-being. Biomarkers such as heart rate variability or those extracted from the electrodermal activity signal are commonly considered as indices of autonomic nervous system functioning, providing objective indicators of stress response. A model combining a set of these biomarkers can constitute a comprehensive tool to remotely assess mental well-being and distress. Objective: This study aims to design and validate a remote multiparametric tool, including physiological and cognitive variables, to objectively assess mental well-being and distress. Methods: This ongoing observational study pursues to enroll 60 young participants (aged 18-34 years) in 3 groups, including participants with high mental well-being, participants with mild to moderate psychological distress, and participants diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are being evaluated through a web-based questionnaire, and for those with a mental health condition, the criteria are identified by psychologists. The assessment consists of collecting mental health self-reported measures and physiological data during a baseline state, the Stroop Color and Word Test as a stress-inducing stage, and a final recovery period. Several variables related to heart rate variability, pulse arrival time, breathing, electrodermal activity, and peripheral temperature are collected using medical and wearable devices. A second assessment is carried out after 1 month. The assessment tool will be developed using self-reported questionnaires assessing well-being (short version of Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) as the reference. We will perform correlation and principal component analysis to reduce the number of variables, followed by the calculation of multiple regression models. Test-retest reliability, known-group validity, and predictive validity will be assessed. Results: Participant recruitment is being carried out on a university campus and in mental health services. Recruitment commenced in October 2022 and is expected to be completed by June 2024. As of July 2023, we have recruited 41 participants. Most participants correspond to the group with mild to moderate psychological distress (n=20, 49%), followed by the high mental well-being group (n=13, 32%) and those diagnosed with a mental health condition (n=8, 20%). Data preprocessing is currently ongoing, and publication of the first results is expected by September 2024. Conclusions: This study will establish an initial framework for a comprehensive mental health assessment tool, taking measurements from sophisticated devices, with the goal of progressing toward a remotely accessible and objectively measured approach that maintains an acceptable level of accuracy in clinical practice and epidemiological studies. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - With technological advances in wearable health care monitoring system, there increasing demands for the patterning technology for reliable sensors. Dry-film photoresists (DFRs) have several advantages for the patterning of silver nanowires (AgNWs), including cost-effectiveness, low toxicity of the process, and ease of mass production through a roll-to-roll process. In this study, using DFRs, we achieved the facile fabrication of AgNW-based chips for optical detection of myoglobin (Mb) via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Mb is found in accessible biological fluids such as urine and serum, which is a representative protein biomarker for human health monitoring. AgNWs were successfully patterned on polyethylene terephthalate films using DFR to form multiple spots, with a diameter of ~500 µm, that are available for detection. SERS spectra showed that the AgNW chips can efficiently detect myoglobin proteins down to levels of clinical significance. Our results will provide insights for the cost-effective production method of futuristic health care monitoring system. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Wireless vital parameter continuous monitoring (WVPCM) after discharge is compared to regular monitoring to provide data on the clinical-economic impact of complex patients (CPs) discharged from Internal Medicine Units of Ospedale dei Castelli, Lazio. Primary outcome: Major complications (MC) reduction. Secondary outcomes: Patients who reached discharge criteria within the 7th day from admission; difference in MC incidence at the conclusion of the standard telemonitoring/clinical monitoring phase, 5 and 30 days after discharge; and conditions predisposing to MC occurrence. Methods: Open label randomized controlled trial with wearable wireless system that creates alerts on portable devices. Continuous glycemic monitoring is performed for patients with diabetes mellitus. Results: There were 110 patients enrolled (mean age: 76.2 years). Comorbidity: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS-CI (comorbidities index): 3.93, CIRS SI (severity index): 1.93. About 19% scored a BRASS (Blaylock Risk Assessment Screening Score) ≥20 indicating need for discharge planning requiring step-down care. Globally, 48% of patients in the control group had major complications (27 out of 56 patients), in contrast to 22% in the intervention group (12 out of 54 patients). Conclusions: Since WVPCM detects early complications during the post-discharge CPs monitoring, it increases safety and reduces inappropriate access to the Emergency Room, preventing avoidable re-hospitalizations. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been gaining interest and received adaptation in healthcare sectors since the COVID-19 pandemic due to their efficiency and capability to deliver timely healthcare services while containing COVID-19 transmission. These systems were developed using the latest technology in wireless sensors, medical devices, cloud computing, mobile computing, telecommunications, and machine learning technologies. In this article, a real-time remote patient monitoring system is proposed with an accessible, compact, accurate, and low-cost design. The implemented system is designed to an end-to-end communication interface between medical practitioners and patients. The objective of this study is to provide remote healthcare services to patients who need ongoing care or those who have been discharged from the hospital without affecting their daily routines. The developed monitoring system was then evaluated on 1177 records from MIMIC-III clinical dataset (aged between 19 and 99 years). The performance analysis of the proposed system achieved 88.7% accuracy in generating alerts with logistic regression classification algorithm. This result reflects positively on the quality and robustness of the proposed study. Since the processing time of the proposed system is less than 2 minutes, it can be stated that the system has a high computational speed and is convenient to use in real-time monitoring. Furthermore, the proposed system will fulfil to cover the lower doctor-to-patient ratio by monitoring patients from remote locations and aged people who reside in their residences. © 2023 Htet Yamin Ko Ko et al.

AB  - Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide crucial information for evaluating a patient’s cardiovascular health; however, they are not always easily accessible. Photoplethysmography (PPG), a technology commonly used in wearable devices such as smartwatches, has shown promise for constructing ECGs. Several methods have been proposed for ECG reconstruction using PPG signals, but some require signal alignment during the training phase, which is not feasible in real-life settings where ECG signals are not collected at the same time as PPG signals. To address this challenge, we introduce PPG2ECGps, an end-to-end, patient-specific deep-learning neural network utilizing the W-Net architecture. This novel approach enables direct ECG signal reconstruction from PPG signals, eliminating the need for signal alignment. Our experiments show that the proposed model achieves mean values of 0.977 mV for Pearson’s correlation coefficient, 0.037 mV for the root mean square error, and 0.010 mV for the normalized dynamic time-warped distance when comparing reconstructed ECGs to reference ECGs from a dataset of 500 records. As PPG signals are more accessible than ECG signals, our proposed model has significant potential to improve patient monitoring and diagnosis in healthcare settings via wearable devices. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The promise of remote patient monitoring (RPM) lies in its ability to revolutionize health care delivery by enabling continuous, real-time tracking of patient health outside traditional clinical settings. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the adoption of RPM, particularly in underserved and rural populations, highlighting both its potential and the persistent barriers that limit its widespread use. This paper explores the critical role of technological advancements—such as wear-ables, artificial intelligence (AI), and broadband expansion—in sustaining and optimizing RPM in the postpandemic era. We examine Michigan as a microcosm of national health care challenges, focusing on its diverse population and geographic barriers, and propose condition-specific RPM protocols to address these inequities. Key facilitators and barriers to RPM implementation are discussed, with a focus on AI integration, community engagement, and digital infrastructure. We also explore the role of policy reform and public–private partnerships in supporting RPM’s scalability and long-term sustainability. Our findings suggest that while RPM offers a powerful tool for improving health care access and outcomes, especially for chronic conditions and rural maternal health, sustained investment in technology and infrastructure is critical. By addressing these challenges, RPM can become a cornerstone of modern health care, reducing disparities and improving care delivery for underserved populations. © MARY ANN LIEBERT, INC.

AB  - Objective: Multidisciplinary rehabilitation facilitates post-stroke functional recovery, but is associated with resource and accessibility barriers. This study evaluated the combination of a wearable device-assisted system (WEAR) and conventional therapy for post-stroke rehabilitation. Methods: This randomized, controlled, parallel group, clinical trial was conducted at two rehabilitation centers. A WEAR system was developed featuring sensors and application program-embedded smartphones. Stroke patients within 12 weeks of onset and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores of 2 to 4 were randomized into a wearable group (WG, WEAR + conventional rehabilitation) or control group (CG, conventional rehabilitation) for 90 days. The primary outcome was mRS score changes within 90 days. Results: Among 127 stroke patients enrolled (76 men [59.8%]; mean age: 57.5 years), 63 and 64 patients were randomized to WG and CG, respectively. Both groups showed significant improvements in mRS scores. Between-group repeated measures analysis adjusted for sex, age and number of rehabilitation sessions showed greater improvement in mRS scores within 90 days in the WG than in the CG (estimate: 0.73). Conclusions: This combined WEAR and conventional rehabilitation approach may improve post-stroke functional recovery compared with conventional rehabilitation alone. The WEAR system permits remote monitoring and recording of rehabilitation in various settings. This clinical trial was retrospectively registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov with the Unique Identifier NCT04997408. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Over 80% of maternal deaths are preventable. Telehealth approaches can help address disparities by increasing access to quality maternal health care. In this position statement, we advocate for the utility of telehealth to address maternal mortality disparities, focusing specifically on the postpartum period, where most maternal deaths occur. Specifically, we describe how telehealth visits, mobile health applications, and wearable devices for remote patient monitoring can be used to promote the uptake of postpartum care and adherence to evidence-based treatment for the most common causes of maternal death (i.e., cardiovascular conditions and mental health-related conditions). We discuss challenges that must be overcome to ensure the broad and equitable reach of telehealth and identify specific action steps to address this pressing public health issue.

AB  - This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Over the past two decades, there has been a notable and swift advancement in the field of healthcare with regards to the Internet of Things (IoT). This progress has brought forth a substantial prospect for healthcare services to enhance performance, transparency, and cost effectiveness. Internet of Things gateways, such as local computational facilities, mobile devices, or custom miniature computational embedded electronics like the Raspberry Pi (RPi), are crucial in facilitating the required processing and data compression tasks as well as serving as front-end event detectors. Numerous home-based healthcare monitoring systems are currently accessible; however, they have several limitations. This paper examines the role of the Raspberry Pi gateway in the healthcare system, specifically in the context of pre-operative prehabilitation programs (PoPPs). The IoT remote monitoring system employed a Microduino integrated with various supporting boards as a wearable device. Additionally, a Raspberry Pi was utilised as a base station or mobile gateway, while ThingSpeak served as the cloud platform. The monitoring system was developed with the purpose of assisting healthcare personnel in real time, remotely monitoring patients while engaging in one or more of the nine typical physical activities that are often prescribed to individuals participating in a prehabilitation program. Furthermore, an alert notification system was designed to notify the clinician and patient if the values were abnormal (i.e., the patient had not been active for many days). The integration of IOT and Raspberry Pi technology into a pre-operative prehabilitation program yielded a promising outcome with a success rate of 78%. Consequently, this intervention is expected to facilitate the resolution of challenges encountered by healthcare providers and patients, including extended waiting periods and constraints related to staffing and infrastructure. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The development of high-performance glucose sensors is an urgent need, especially for diabetes mellitus diagnosis. However, the glucose monitoring is conventionally operated in an invasive finger-prick manner and their noninvasive alternatives largely suffered from the relatively poor sensitivity, selectivity, and stability, resulted from the lack of robust and efficient catalysts. In this paper, we design a concave shaped nitrogen-doped carbon framework embellished with single Co site catalyst (Co SSC) by selectively controlling the etching rate on different facet of carbon substrate, which is beneficial to the diffusion and contact of analyte. The Co SSC prompts a significant improvement in the sensitivity of the solution-gated graphene transistor (SGGT) devices, with three orders of magnitude better than those of SGGT devices without catalysts. Our findings expand the field of single site catalyst in the application of biosensors, diabetes diagnostics and personalized health-care monitoring. © 2020 Science China Press

AB  - Background: Adhesive capsulitis (AC) of the shoulder is a common disorder that painfully reduces the shoulder range of motion (ROM) among middle-aged individuals. Although physical therapy with home-based exercises is widely advised to restore ROM in the treatment of AC, clinical results vary owing to inconsistent patient compliance. Objective: In this study, we aimed to verify the feasibility of a treatment model that involves applying a wearable motion sensor device to assist patients conduct home-based exercises to improve training compliance and the accuracy of exercises, with the ultimate goal of improving the functional recovery of patients with AC. Methods: The motion sensor device was comprised of inertial measurement unit-based sensors and mobile apps for patients and physicians, offering shoulder mobility tracing, home-based exercise support, and progress monitoring. The interrater reliability of shoulder mobility measurement using the motion sensor device on 10 healthy participants and 15 patients with AC was obtained using an intraclass correlation coefficient analysis and compared with the assessments performed by two highly experienced physicians. A pilot prospective control trial was then carried out to allocate the 15 patients with AC to two groups: home-based exercise group and motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group. Changes in active and passive shoulder ROM, pain and functional scores, and exercise completion rates were compared between the groups during a treatment period of 3 months. Results: Shoulder ROM, as measured using the motion sensor device, exhibited good to excellent reliability based on the comparison with the measurements of two physicians (intraclass correlation coefficient range, 0.771 to 0.979). Compared with patients with AC in the home-based exercise group, those in the motion sensor-assisted rehabilitation group exhibited better shoulder mobility and functional recovery and a higher exercise completion rate during and after 3 months of rehabilitation. Conclusions: Motion sensor device-assisted home-based rehabilitation for the treatment of AC is a useful treatment model for telerehabilitation that enhances the compliance of patients through training, thus improving functional recovery. This helps overcome important obstacles in physiotherapy at home by providing comprehensible and easily accessible exercise instructions, enhancing compliance, ensuring the correctness of exercise, and monitoring the progress of patients. © 2020 Yu-Pin Chen.

AB  - This article presents a novel hardware-assisted distributed ledger-based solution for simultaneous device and data security in smart healthcare. This article presents a novel architecture that integrates PUF, blockchain, and Tangle for Security-by-Design (SbD) of healthcare cyber–physical systems (H-CPSs). Healthcare systems around the world have undergone massive technological transformation and have seen growing adoption with the advancement of Internet-of-Medical Things (IoMT). The technological transformation of healthcare systems to telemedicine, e-health, connected health, and remote health is being made possible with the sophisticated integration of IoMT with machine learning, big data, artificial intelligence (AI), and other technologies. As healthcare systems are becoming more accessible and advanced, security and privacy have become pivotal for the smooth integration and functioning of various systems in H-CPSs. In this work, we present a novel approach that integrates PUF with IOTA Tangle and blockchain and works by storing the PUF keys of a patient’s Body Area Network (BAN) inside blockchain to access, store, and share globally. Each patient has a network of smart wearables and a gateway to obtain the physiological sensor data securely. To facilitate communication among various stakeholders in healthcare systems, IOTA Tangle’s Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) communication protocol has been used, which securely enables patients to communicate, share, and store data on Tangle. The MAM channel works in the restricted mode in the proposed architecture, which can be accessed using the patient’s gateway PUF key. Furthermore, the successful verification of PUF enables patients to securely send and share physiological sensor data from various wearable and implantable medical devices embedded with PUF. Finally, healthcare system entities like physicians, hospital admin networks, and remote monitoring systems can securely establish communication with patients using MAM and retrieve the patient’s BAN PUF keys from the blockchain securely. Our experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach successfully integrates three security primitives, PUF, blockchain, and Tangle, providing decentralized access control and security in H-CPS with minimal energy requirements, data storage, and response time. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Metal elements, including noble and transition metals, have always been required in the design of electrochemical sensors. Despite great advances, some drawbacks like the release of metal ions and exfoliation of catalysts from substrates still exist. Acid oxidation treatment, as a simple and effective way, is commonly used in the surface treatment of carbon materials, extensively used either directly as capacitive and catalytic electrodes or as the current collectors. However, its potential to be directly applied for electrochemical sensing has not been explored enough. In this work, a metal-free electrochemical sensor based on a surface oxygen-functionalized carbon cloth (CC) is fabricated through a simple acid oxidation treatment, during which more oxygen-containing groups are introduced, ensuring the solvent-accessible hydrophilic surface of electrodes and the improved surface interaction with dopamine. Our results suggest that the enhanced dopamine sensing performance can be obtained just through the introduction of oxygen-containing groups. Compared with raw CC, the acid-oxidized CC (AOCC) exhibits improved electrochemical sensing performance. A high sensitivity (9320 μA mM-1 cm-2), a low detection limit (10 nM), and a wide linear range (0.1-104.5 μM) are achieved. The selectivity, stability, and reproducibility are also proved to be satisfactory. Furthermore, the flexibility of AOCC endows its promising potential in fabricating wearable and soft electronics for human healthcare monitoring.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Pressure sensors with high flexibility and sensitivity face significant challenges in meeting the delicate balance and synergy among suitable active sensing electrode materials, substrates, and their device geometry design. In this contribution, layer-engineered delaminated Ti-MXene (DL-Ti3C2Tx) is introduced, which has relatively wider interlayer spacing through intercalated large organic molecules and accordion-like open internal microstructure than the narrower pristine Ti3C2Tx MXene (Ti-MXene), graphene/carbon nanotube's interlayer spacing suitably fulfill the high sensitivity and flexibility requirement through accessible electronic pathways under the external pressure. Notably, a milder in-situ ambient condition etching is performed to eliminate the associated safety risks for a flexible personal healthcare monitoring pressure sensor. DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene-empowered, flexible pressure sensor demonstrates a broad range of sensitivities up to a very high-pressure of 20.8 kPa at a sensitivity of 242.3 kPa−1 with a fast response and recovery time (<300 ms). A twofold increase in pressure sensitivity performance of DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene than that of Ti-MXene, graphene can be attributed to the engineered wider interlayer distance among the delaminated DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene layers causing a facile interlayer atomic movements, contacts, and reversible compressibility. The current economical, scalable DL-Ti3C2Tx MXene flexible pressure sensor can provide future safe personal healthcare artificial intelligence with real-time tracking ability. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Background: Maintaining physical function and preserving spinal flexibility have been challenging in managing ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Most rehabilitation programs, including manual therapy, massage, hydrotherapy, and acupuncture, cannot be performed at home. The effect of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was validated in treating AS, but no home TENS system has explored its efficacy to date. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a home TENS system with a novel treatment program for patients with AS. Methods: The modified WeHeal TS-200 TENS and galvanic response system provided home-based TENS treatment for patients with AS. Patients were divided into a 2-month course group and a 1-month course group. After the first treatment course, patients went through a washout period for the same duration of their treatment course. Participants could decide whether to accept the second course of treatment. The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI), Schober test, finger-to-floor flexion test, enthesis score, cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory factors, and immunoglobulins were measured to evaluate its efficacy. The clinical trial protocol (1096607481) received approval from the Ministry of Health and Welfare in Taiwan. Results: A total of 9 patients (5 in a 2-month course group and 4 in a 1-month course group) completed the first treatment course, and 5 patients (4 in a 2-month course group and 1 in a 1-month course group) completed the sequential treatment course. The weighted results showed that patients reported an improving BASFI score (mean difference –0.9, SD 1.7; P=.03) after treatment. Looking into the trajectories, declined BASFI and BASDAI scores were noticed during treatments; this score increased during the washout period. There were improving trends in the Schober test (mean difference 1.9, SD 4.9; P=.11) and finger-to-floor flexion test (mean difference –0.6, SD 9.5; P=.79), but the results were not statistically significant. The response of cytokines, chemokines, inflammatory factors, and immunoglobulins before and after treatment did not show a consistent trend, and all results were not statistically significant (all P>.05). Conclusions: The home TENS device demonstrated a potential role in AS management. It may improve accessibility and adherence for patients with AS and provide remote monitoring for clinicians. Further research can compare the effectiveness of electrotherapy at home or in a medical setting and focus on integrating the home TENS system and exercise program to enhance patients’ physical functions and spinal flexibility. ©Yu-Chih Lin, Chen-Ching Wu, Wan-Yu Sung, Jeng-Hsien Yen, Yi-Ching Lin.

AB  - Introduction. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is an inflammatory condition affecting over 25% of adults. Web/mobile technology offers potential benefits in the treatment of KOA by improving access to care and reducing costs by utilising mobile devices for medical care and patient education. Aim. The study aims to answer the question of what needs, functional requirements and aesthetic preferences patients with knee osteoarthritis have and what barriers and facilitators there are when using an app-based therapy. Material and methods. We used a qualitative research design with in-depth interviews with 20 patients. Results and conclusion. Interviewees emphasized that effective KOA management apps must address diverse patient needs, ensure accessibility, offer customizable features, provide comprehensive information and self-management tools, support pain relief, enable remote monitoring, integrate with support communities, and be cost-efficient. These apps should combine functional requirements, such as a simple user interface, integration with wearable devices, educational content, exercise guidance, pain management tools, remote consultations, community support, and feedback mechanisms, with aesthetic preferences for clear, accessible design, large fonts, high-contrast colours, suitable interactive elements, consistent layout, guiding animations, and accessibility features like text resizing, voice commands, and audio descriptions. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity for KOA management apps to integrate diverse functional requirements and aesthetic preferences, ensuring accessibility, customization, comprehensive information, and support features to enhance usability, effectiveness, and patient satisfaction. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Wearable devices and deep learning methods for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) have attracted a lot of interest because they could change healthcare monitoring. This study presents a CNN-LSTM model to accurately and reliably detect human movements from smartphone sensor data. The proposed model takes advantage of both the strengths of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling time and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for extracting features from space. This enables determining how the input data change over time and space. This study examines whether this method can work and is practical in real-life healthcare settings, focused on uses such as watching patients from distance, caring for the elderly, and therapy. The proposed model was evaluated on publicly accessible standard datasets. Various architectural configurations and hyperparameters were examined to determine their performance. The proposed CNN-LSTM model performed well and has great potential for practical use in activity tracking and environment understanding systems. © by the authors.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.  © 1975-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose This article demonstrates the leadership role of the clinical nurse specialist in developing and implementing healthcare technology across the continuum of care. Description Three virtual nursing practices - facilitated self-care, remote patient monitoring, and virtual acute care nursing - illustrate how the clinical nurse specialist is well suited to transform traditional practice models to ones that use healthcare technology effectively. These 3 practices use interactive healthcare technology to gather patient data and allow communication and coordination with the healthcare team to meet patient-specific needs. Outcome Use of healthcare technology in virtual nursing practices led to early care team intervention, optimized care team processes, proactive patient outreach, timely access to care, and reduction in healthcare-associated errors and near-miss events. Conclusion Clinical nurse specialists are well positioned to develop innovative, effective, accessible, and high-quality virtual nursing practices. Integrating healthcare technology with nursing practice augments care for various patients, ranging from those with low illness severity in the outpatient setting to acutely ill patients in the inpatient hospital environment.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Stride-to-stride fluctuations during walking reflect age-related changes in gait adaptability and are estimated with nonlinear measures that confine data collection to controlled settings. Smartphones, with their embedded accelerometers, may provide accessible gait analysis throughout the day. This study investigated age-related differences in linear and nonlinear gait measures estimated from a smartphone accelerometer (SPAcc) in an unconstrained, free-living environment. Thirteen young adults (YA) and 11 older adults (OA) walked within a shopping mall with a SPAcc placed in their front right pants pocket. The inter-stride interval, calculated as the time difference between ipsilateral heel contacts, was used for dependent measures calculations. One-way repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed significant (p < 0.05) age-related differences (mean: YA, OA) for stride-time standard deviation (0.04 s, 0.05 s) and coefficient of variation (3.47%, 4.16%), sample entropy (SaEn) scale 1 (1.70, 1.86) and scale 3 (2.12, 1.80), and statistical persistence decay (31 strides, 23 strides). The fractal scaling index was not different between groups (0.93, 0.95), but exceeded those typically found in controlled settings, suggesting an upregulation in adaptive behaviour likely to accommodate the increased challenge of free-living walking. These findings support the SPAcc as a viable telehealth instrument for remote monitoring of gait dynamics, with implications for unsupervised fall-risk assessment. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Tele-Health services provide people with healthcare assistance and help to establish accessible and high-quality monitoring. Telematic healthcare administration offers direct aid through the Internet of Things (IoT), which is better than current methods involving physical presence. The IoT and sensor networks currently enable remote monitoring of an individual or community. There are different Energy Level (EL) estimation methods for aerobics using body-worn sensors; however, quantification of error estimation differences is lacking. In this article, the Internet of Things based Energy Level Estimation method (IoT-ELEM) has been proposed for determining energy rates. The latter two forms of calculation are accompanied by a list of behaviors and EL approximations. Likewise, the amount and location of accelerometer sensors have been examined to achieve maximal EL estimates in aerobic players. The device is built on a distributed design that gathers a person's physiological data from various sensors data and conducts a standardization phase. These results are all transmitted to the cloud for storing and further processing. The cloud device manages the obtained details and performs a data fusion procedure to display the EL of the user at all stages. The IoT-ELEM system has been evaluated and achieves a high accuracy ratio of 98.6%, a prediction ratio of 96.4%, a performance ratio of 97.8, a less error rate of 9.4%, and an F1 score ratio of 94.6%. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Purpose As the global population continue to age, tracking vital signs such as heart rate becomes crucial (Dias & Paulo Silva Cunha, 2018). However, traditional methods for monitoring these vital signs, particularly through wearable sensors, often present challenges. As noted in the study (Vijayan, Connolly, Condell, McKelvey, & Gardiner, 2021), wearables can be cumbersome for users, particularly older adults who may find these devices uncomfortable or intrusive, potentially leading to low adherence and compromising the reliability of health data collection. However, the rise of non-invasive Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technology offers a more accessible solution (Lussier et al., 2020). By utilizing sensors embedded within the living environment, AAL systems can continuously gather vital health data without requiring direct interaction or causing discomfort to the individual. This research focuses on merging effortless smart home ambient technology and machine learning to predict the heart rate of old individuals. The primary aim is to accurately monitor heart rate during daily activities using non-intrusive, remote methods facilitated by AAL technology, without requiring active participation from the subjects. Method This study was conducted in a specially designed smart home environment (Figure 1) equipped with a wide range of non-contact ambient sensors, which were used to collect environmental, electrical, and presence data. Heart rate benchmark data was collected using the Empatica E4 wristband. Forty participants were selected and instructed to perform 23 specific daily activities, organized into five practical phases, within this smart home setting. The data collected from the smart home environment and the heart rate readings were subsequently analyzed using five widely used machine learning methods: Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Multilayer Perceptron. Results and Discussion The machine learning models delivered notable predictive results, averaging a Mean Absolute Error of 7.329. Notably, the Random Forest model excelled above the rest, registering a Mean Absolute Error of 6.023 and a Scatter Index at 9.72%. This model excelled in identifying the correlation between daily activities and fluctuations in heart rate, showcasing a peak R2 value of 0.782 during the activity of morning exercises. The proposed non-invasive method offers a novel perspective on remote monitoring heart rate variations across daily living activities. This study's insights hold substantial relevance for public health. Leveraging contact-free smart home tech to estimate heart rate during everyday tasks allows health professionals to grasp a person's cardiovascular health more holistically. Such insights pave the way for tailored interventions, preventive actions, and lifestyle changes, ultimately aiming to lower cardiovascular disease risks and enhance overall health. © (2024), (International Society for Gerontechnology).

AB  - Hospitalized patients often are readmitted soon after discharge, with many hospitalizations being potentially preventable. The authors evaluated a mobile health intervention designed to improve post-hospitalization support for older adults with common chronic conditions. All participants enrolled with an informal caregiver or "CarePartner" (CP). Intervention patients received automated assessment and behavior change calls. CPs received automated, structured feedback following each assessment. Clinicians received alerts about serious problems identified during patient calls. Controls had a 65% greater risk of hospitalization within 90 days post discharge than intervention patients (P =.041). For every 6.8 enrollees, the intervention prevented 1 rehospitalization or emergency department encounter. The intervention improved physical functioning at 90 days (P =.012). The intervention also improved medication adherence and indicators of the quality of communication with CPs (all P <.01). Automated telephone patient monitoring and self-care advice with feedback to primary care teams and CPs reduces readmission rates over 90 days. © 2021 SAGE Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - The medical technology sector is characterised by a constant influx of innovations with the potential to revolutionise patient care. In France, there are several pathways for medical devices to enter the market, from diagnosis-related group tariffs to reimbursement lists. However, traditional regulatory pathways can delay market access for innovative technologies. In response, France has established Early Access Programs to expedite patient access to medical devices. This paper looks at three of these Early Access Programs for medical devices. Innovation Funding, introduced in its final version in 2015, provides temporary coverage for innovative devices and facilitates data collection for informed funding decisions. Transitional Coverage (PECT), established in 2021, targets CE-marked devices for rare or serious conditions. Transitional coverage for digital health applications (PECAN), introduced in 2022, covers digital medical devices, either therapeutic or for patient monitoring. Innovation funding has been granted to 16 technologies out of 35 applications (46%) since 2015. 6 technologies out of 11 (64%) applications benefit from PECT. PECAN, in its first year, has granted a telemonitoring solution with a favourable opinion. The French experience could provide valuable lessons for the development of a harmonised European framework to ensure that innovative medical technologies benefit those who need them, while maintaining high safety standards. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Architectural, cognitive, and service layers are the three components that come together to form the system as a whole. The data that is acquired by the instruments at the application layer is processed by the system that is in charge of the network. The conceptual layer, which is where edge sensors are put, is responsible for managing radio resource management and intersensor connections in order to solve the issues raised by the physical layer about increasing power consumption and increased latency. In response to the processed data provided by the logical layer, the application layer will make judgements. The key objective is to lower prices so that they are more accessible to regular people. Patients will not only be able to maintain their financial stability, but they will also have easy access to private therapy. This research presents a solution based on the Internet of Things (IoT), which will simplify the usage of a generally complicated medical device while allowing you to do it at a reasonable cost and in the comfort of your own home. The Elephant Herding Optimizations using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) method is discussed here in order to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy patterns of behavior. The scoring function, also known as fuzzy logic, is used in order to arrive at a conclusion on the severity of the irregularity. In the end, tests were carried out to see how well the recommended work fared in contrast to the existing approaches in terms of specificity, recall, f1-score, and ROC curve. These metrics were examined.  © 2023 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Internet of Medical Things (IoMTs) is fast emerging, thereby fostering rapid advances in the areas of sensing, actuation and connectivity to significantly improve the quality and accessibility of health care for everyone. Implantable medical device (IMD) is an example of such an IoMT-enabled device. IMDs treat the patient’s health and give a mechanism to provide regular remote monitoring to the healthcare providers. However, the current wireless communication channels can curb the security and privacy of these devices by allowing an attacker to interfere with both the data and communication. The privacy and security breaches in IMDs have thereby alarmed both the health providers and government agencies. Ensuring security of these small devices is a vital task to prevent severe health consequences to the bearer. The attacks can range from system to infrastructure levels where both the software and hardware of the IMD are compromised. In the recent years, biometric and cryptographic approaches to authentication, machine learning approaches to anomaly detection and external wearable devices for wireless communication protection have been proposed. However, the existing solutions for wireless medical devices are either heavy for memory constrained devices or require additional devices to be worn. To treat the present situation, there is a requirement to facilitate effective and secure data communication by introducing policies that will incentivize the development of security techniques. This paper proposes a novel electrocardiogram authentication scheme which uses Legendre approximation coupled with multi-layer perceptron model for providing three levels of security for data, network and application levels. The proposed model can reach up to 99.99% testing accuracy in identifying the authorized personnel even with 5 coefficients. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and discovery of new mutant strains have a devastating impact worldwide. Patients with severe COVID-19 require various equipment, such as ventilators, infusion pumps, and patient monitors, and a dedicated medical team to operate and monitor the equipment in isolated intensive care units (ICUs). Medical staff must wear personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of infection. This study proposes a tele-monitoring system for isolation ICUs to assist in the monitoring of COVID-19 patients. The tele-monitoring system consists of three parts: medical-device panel image processing, transmission, and tele-monitoring. This system can monitor the ventilator screen with obstacles, receive and store data, and provide real-time monitoring and data analysis. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compared with previous studies, and the image combination algorithm for reconstruction is evaluated using structural similarity index (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The system achieves an SSIM score of 0.948 in the left side and a PSNR of 23.414 dB in the right side with no obstacles. It also reduces blind spots, with an SSIM score of 0.901 and a PSNR score of 18.13 dB. The proposed tele-monitoring system is compatible with both wired and wireless communication, making it accessible in various situations. It uses camera and performs live data monitoring, and the two monitoring systems complement each other. The system also includes a comprehensive database and an analysis tool, allowing medical staff to collect and analyze data on ventilator use, providing them a quick, at-a-glance view of the patient's condition. With the implementation of this system, patient outcomes may be improved and the burden on medical professionals may be reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic-like situations. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Background: Vital sign measurements are an integral component of clinical care, but current challenges with the accuracy and timeliness of patient observations can impact appropriate clinical decision making. Advanced technologies using techniques such as photoplethysmography have the potential to automate noncontact physiological monitoring and recording, improving the quality and accessibility of this essential clinical information. Objective: In this study, we aim to develop the algorithm used in the Lifelight software application and improve the accuracy of its estimated heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure measurements. Methods: This preliminary study will compare measurements predicted by the Lifelight software with standard of care measurements for an estimated population sample of 2000 inpatients, outpatients, and healthy people attending a large acute hospital. Both training datasets and validation datasets will be analyzed to assess the degree of correspondence between the vital sign measurements predicted by the Lifelight software and the direct physiological measurements taken using standard of care methods. Subgroup analyses will explore how the performance of the algorithm varies with particular patient characteristics, including age, sex, health condition, and medication. Results: Recruitment of participants to this study began in July 2018, and data collection will continue for a planned study period of 12 months. Conclusions: Digital health technology is a rapidly evolving area for health and social care. Following this initial exploratory study to develop and refine the Lifelight software application, subsequent work will evaluate its performance across a range of health characteristics, and extended validation trials will support its pathway to registration as a medical device. Innovations in health technology such as this may provide valuable opportunities for increasing the efficiency and accessibility of vital sign measurements and improve health care services on a large scale across multiple health and care settings. © Thomas L Jones, Emily Heiden, Felicity Mitchell, Carole Fogg, Sharon McCready, Laurence Pearce, Melissa Kapoor, Paul Bassett, Anoop J Chauhan.

AB  - Ubiquitous computing has been a green research area that has managed to attract and sustain the attention of researchers for some time now. As ubiquitous computing applications, human activity recognition and localization have also been popularly worked on. These applications are used in healthcare monitoring, behavior analysis, personal safety, and entertainment. A robust model has been proposed in this article that works over IoT data extracted from smartphone and smartwatch sensors to recognize the activities performed by the user and, in the meantime, classify the location at which the human performed that particular activity. The system starts by denoising the input signal using a second-order Butterworth filter and then uses a hamming window to divide the signal into small data chunks. Multiple stacked windows are generated using three windows per stack, which, in turn, prove helpful in producing more reliable features. The stacked data are then transferred to two parallel feature extraction blocks, i.e., human activity recognition and human localization. The respective features are extracted for both modules that reinforce the system’s accuracy. A recursive feature elimination is applied to the features of both categories independently to select the most informative ones among them. After the feature selection, a genetic algorithm is used to generate ten different generations of each feature vector for data augmentation purposes, which directly impacts the system’s performance. Finally, a deep neural decision forest is trained for classifying the activity and the subject’s location while working on both of these attributes in parallel. For the evaluation and testing of the proposed system, two openly accessible benchmark datasets, the ExtraSensory dataset and the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, were used. The system outperformed the available state-of-the-art systems by recognizing human activities with an accuracy of 88.25% and classifying the location with an accuracy of 90.63% over the ExtraSensory dataset, while, for the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion dataset, the respective results were 96.00% and 90.50% accurate. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS. © 2001-2011 IEEE.
