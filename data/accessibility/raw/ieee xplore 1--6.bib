  abstract={Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) is considered a serious public health problem due to the uncertainty of its onset. Consuming wearable devices have increasing popularities for healthcare monitoring, and many of them are capable of continuous monitoring and early detection of CVDs. This paper proposes a framework for heart sound detection that can be considered for deployment on smart wearable devices to screen CVDs conveniently. A dual-stream convolutional neural network (DS-CNN) is developed to detect abnormal ones from short-term heart sound recordings. Preprocessing module is first employed for noise filtering and amplitude normalization. Then short-time Fourier transform and higher-order spectral are introduced for feature extraction, whose products are subsequently fed into the DS-CNN for screening abnormal heart sound signals. Two open accessible datasets are employed for performance evaluation. The results well demonstrate the classification accuracy of the proposed DS-CNN, and also indicate its advantages for adapting to heart sound recordings collected by different equipments.},

  abstract={Telemonitoring is a branch of telehealth that aims at remotely monitoring vital signs, which is important for chronically ill patients and the elderly living alone. The available standalone devices and applications for the self-monitoring of health parameters largely suffer from interoperability problems; meanwhile, telemonitoring medical devices are expensive, self-contained, and are not integrated into user-friendly technological platforms for the end user. This paper presents the technical aspects and usability assessment of the telemonitoring features of the HEREiAM platform, which supports heterogeneous information technology systems. By exploiting a service-oriented architecture, the measured parameters collected by off-the-shelf Bluetooth medical devices are sent as XML documents to a private cloud that implements an interoperable health service infrastructure, which is compliant with the most recent healthcare standards and security protocols. This Android-based system is designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, and includes other utilities designed to support the elderly living alone. Four usability assessment sessions with quality-validated questionnaires were performed to accurately understand the ease of use, usefulness, acceptance, and quality of the proposed system. The results reveal that our system achieved very high usability scores even at its first use, and the scores did not significantly change over time during a field trial that lasted for four months, reinforcing the idea of an intuitive design. At the end of such a trial, the user-experience questionnaire achieved excellent scores in all aspects with respect to the benchmark. Good results were also reported by general practitioners who assessed the quality of their remote interfaces for telemonitoring.},

  abstract={Pregnant women and neonates are the most affected demographic group by the shortfall of accessible healthcare. In this work, we aimed to improve obstetric facilities in rural India by proposing a remote maternal health monitoring device in which pregnant women can avail healthcare services without long-distance travel. We designed and developed a prototype of the proposed device using the open-source Shakti processor to provide remote real-time monitoring of the fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions for the detection of any abnormalities. Fetal phonocardiography (PCG) signal was picked up using an acoustic sensor, while the electrohysterography (EHG) signal was acquired using surface electrodes placed on a pregnant woman. The placement of the sensor and electrodes was referred by an obstetrician. The system was placed on ten pregnant women in their last trimester with their informed consent and the monitored parameters were validated by a clinician. The obtained FHR and uterine contractions were compared with that from standard clinical devices and the results from the proposed device were observed to be comparable with that of the standard devices.},

  title={A Home Telemedicine System for Continuous Respiratory Monitoring}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={25},
  number={4},
  pages={1247-1256},
  abstract={This article presents a continuous home telemonitoring system for chronic respiratory patients using 5G connectivity developed in partnership with Vodafone as a part of the 5G Trial in Milan established by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development. The system features a wearable respiratory and activity monitor, an environmental sensor and a pulse oximeter sending the data through a 5G router to a Multi-Edge Computing server, incorporated in the Vodafone 5G infrastructure, where they are stored and accessible for visualization. In particular, activity, respiratory and environmental data are continuously streamed and collected. The solution has been tested on 18 healthy volunteers during non-supervised recordings lasting at least 48 hours. The combination of recognized activities and associated respiratory parameters provided statistically significant variations in breathing patterns between one activity and the other, thus giving more complete information to the clinicians than previously studied telemedicine systems based on spot-checks. In particular, statistically significant differences are found in tidal volume and minute ventilation between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001) and between vertical postures and dynamic activities (p < 0.001); the respiratory rate shows statistically significant differences between horizontal and vertical postures (p < 0.001). Some environmental parameters have different mean values between day and night, such as carbon dioxide (p < 0.001). Trials on patients are needed to further study this telemedicine solution and make it commercially available in the future. The main further technical development suggested is the use of commercial 5G smartphones as routers, in order to make the system usable outside of home settings.},

  title={Assessing Free-Living Postural Sway in Persons With Multiple Sclerosis},

  abstract={Postural instability is associated with disease status and fall risk in Persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS). However, assessments of postural instability, known as postural sway, leverage force platforms or wearable accelerometers, and are most often conducted in laboratory environments and are thus not broadly accessible. Remote measures of postural sway captured during daily life may provide a more accessible alterative, but their ability to capture disease status and fall risk has not yet been established. We explored the utility of remote measures of postural sway in a sample of 33 PwMS. Remote measures of sway differed significantly from lab-based measures, but still demonstrated moderately strong associations with patient-reported measures of balance and mobility impairment. Machine learning models for predicting fall risk trained on lab data provided an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.79, while remote data only achieved an AUC of 0.51. Remote model performance improved to an AUC of 0.74 after a new, subject-specific k-means clustering approach was applied for identifying the remote data most appropriate for modelling. This cluster-based approach for analyzing remote data also strengthened associations with patient-reported measures, increasing their strength above those observed in the lab. This work introduces a new framework for analyzing data from remote patient monitoring technologies and demonstrates the promise of remote postural sway assessment for assessing fall risk and characterizing balance impairment in PwMS.},

  abstract={Moved by the necessity, also related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, of the design of innovative solutions in the context of digital health, and digital medicine, Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are more and more emerging as a central system for the implementation of solutions for well-being and healthcare. In fact, by elaborating the data collected by a WBAN, advanced classification models can accurately extract health-related parameters, thus allowing, as examples, the implementations of applications for fitness tracking, monitoring of vital signs, diagnosis, and analysis of the evolution of diseases, and, in general, monitoring of human activities and behaviours. Unfortunately, commercially available WBANs present some technological and economic drawbacks from the point of view, respectively, of data fusion and labelling, and cost of the adopted devices. To overcome existing issues, in this article, we present the architecture of a low-cost WBAN, which is built upon accessible off-the-shelf wearable devices and an Android application. Then, we report its technical evaluation concerning resource consumption. Finally, we demonstrate its versatility and accuracy in both medical and well-being application scenarios.},
